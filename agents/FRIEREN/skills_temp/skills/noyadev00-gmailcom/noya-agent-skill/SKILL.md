# Noya Agent

Noya is a multi-agent AI system for crypto trading, prediction markets (Polymarket, Rain), token analysis, and DCA strategies. All transactions are gas-sponsored — users pay no gas fees.

- **Website:** [agent.noya.ai](https://agent.noya.ai)
- **API Base URL:** `https://safenet.one`

## Trust & Security

- All API calls use HTTPS. Only `NOYA_API_KEY` is read from the environment.
- All on-chain transactions require explicit user confirmation via an interrupt prompt before execution.
- Use a short-lived API key (30-day) for testing. Revoke it from Settings > API Keys if compromised.

## Setup

1. Create an account at [agent.noya.ai](https://agent.noya.ai)
2. Go to Settings > API Keys and generate a key
3. Store the key securely — it is only shown once
4. Set the environment variable:

```bash
export NOYA_API_KEY="noya_your_key_here"
```

Configure in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "entries": {
      "noya-agent": {
        "enabled": true,
        "apiKey": "noya_your_key_here",
        "env": {
          "NOYA_API_KEY": "noya_your_key_here"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## When to Use

Use Noya when users want to:
- Check token prices or portfolio balances
- Swap, bridge, or send tokens (cross-chain supported)
- Analyze tokens and market trends
- Trade on Polymarket or Rain prediction markets
- Set up or manage DCA (dollar-cost averaging) strategies
- View DeFi positions
- Start a voice conversation with the Noya agent

**Don't use for:** Non-crypto tasks, local file operations, or general knowledge questions.

## Core Workflow

Every interaction uses the Noya REST API. The primary endpoint is `POST /api/messages/stream` which returns a streamed response. **Always use the provided `noya-message.sh` script** to send messages — it handles streaming, chunk parsing, and formatted output. Do not call the message endpoint with raw curl.

**OpenClaw integration:** For every new chat OpenClaw initiates with Noya, first call the system message endpoint (step 2.5) to hand off conversation context. This makes the chat feel like a seamless continuation of the user's conversation with OpenClaw.

### 1. Discover Capabilities (first use)

```bash
curl -s -H "x-api-key: $NOYA_API_KEY" \
  "https://safenet.one/api/agents/summarize" | jq '.data'
```

Returns all available agent types (token analysis, prediction markets, DCA, etc.) and their tools. Call this once to understand what Noya can do.

### 2. Generate a Thread ID (new conversation)

Generate a UUID v4 for each new conversation topic:

```bash
python3 -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())"
```

Or on macOS/Linux:

```bash
uuidgen | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
```

Each conversation needs a unique UUID. Generate one per topic and reuse it for follow-ups.

### 2.5 Initialize Thread with Conversation Context (OpenClaw)

**For every new chat that OpenClaw initiates with Noya, call this endpoint first** to set up the conversation context. This makes the chat with Noya feel like a natural continuation of the user's conversation with OpenClaw, rather than starting fresh.

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://safenet.one/api/openclaw/system-message" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $NOYA_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "threadId": "THREAD_ID_HERE",
    "content": "The user has been chatting with OpenClaw and now wants help with crypto/trading tasks. Here is the relevant context from our conversation:\n\n- The user mentioned they have a meeting at 3pm today and want to check their portfolio before then\n- They previously expressed preference for ETH over BTC\n- Their timezone is EST\n- Earlier in our chat, they asked about setting up a DCA strategy\n\nPlease continue assisting them naturally, as if this is a seamless handoff from our conversation."
  }'
```

The `content` field should frame the handoff as a conversation continuation. Include:
- A brief intro explaining the user was chatting with OpenClaw and is now being handed off to Noya
- Relevant context from the OpenClaw conversation (what the user asked about, their goals)
- User's schedule, preferences, and any other helpful details
- A note to continue the conversation naturally

This ensures the user doesn't have to repeat themselves and Noya can pick up where OpenClaw left off.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "filtered": false,
  "message": "Content was sanitized before appending"
}
```

The content passes through a security filter. If `filtered` is `true`, the content was sanitized before being added. If the content is rejected entirely, you'll receive a `400` error with a `reason` field.

**Important:** Call this endpoint *before* sending the first user message via `noya-message.sh`. The system message will be prepended to the thread's context.

### 3. Send Messages (streaming)

Use the provided script to send a message and receive the parsed response:

```bash
bash {baseDir}/noya-message.sh "What tokens do I have in my portfolio?" "THREAD_ID_HERE"
```

The script handles the streaming response, parses `--breakpoint--` delimited JSON chunks, and outputs formatted text including messages, tool results, progress indicators, and interrupt prompts.

### 4. Continue the Conversation

Reuse the same thread ID for follow-ups — Noya maintains context:

```bash
bash {baseDir}/noya-message.sh "Swap 0.1 ETH to USDC" "SAME_THREAD_ID"
```

### 5. Respond to Interrupts

When the agent needs confirmation (e.g., before executing a swap), the output includes `[REQUIRES INPUT]` with options. Send the user's answer as a follow-up in the same thread:

```bash
bash {baseDir}/noya-message.sh "Yes" "SAME_THREAD_ID"
```

## Start Voice Chat

Opens the Noya AI agent in voice chat mode in the user's browser. Use this when the user wants to talk to Noya by voice instead of text.

**Always include `threadIdToUse`** when OpenClaw initiates the voice chat. Since step 2.5 (set system message) creates the thread beforehand with conversation context, you must pass that thread ID to continue the same conversation:

```bash
open "https://agent.noya.ai?mode=voice&threadIdToUse=THREAD_ID_HERE"
```

Only omit `threadIdToUse` if the user explicitly asks to start a completely fresh voice session without any context:

```bash
open "https://agent.noya.ai?mode=voice"
```

On Linux, use `xdg-open` instead of `open`.

## API Reference (curl commands)

All endpoints require the `x-api-key` header. Base URL: `https://safenet.one`

### Send Message (streaming) — ALWAYS use the script

**Do not call `/api/messages/stream` with raw curl.** The response is a custom streamed format that requires parsing. Always use the provided script:

```bash
bash {baseDir}/noya-message.sh "<message>" "<threadId>"
```

The script handles authentication, streaming, `--breakpoint--` chunk parsing, and outputs clean formatted text (messages, tool results, interrupts, progress, errors).

### List Threads

```bash
curl -s -H "x-api-key: $NOYA_API_KEY" \
  "https://safenet.one/api/threads" | jq '.data.threads'
```

### Get Thread Messages

```bash
curl -s -H "x-api-key: $NOYA_API_KEY" \
  "https://safenet.one/api/threads/THREAD_ID/messages" | jq '.data.messages'
```

### Delete Thread

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE -H "x-api-key: $NOYA_API_KEY" \
  "https://safenet.one/api/threads/THREAD_ID"
```

### Get Agent Summary

```bash
curl -s -H "x-api-key: $NOYA_API_KEY" \
  "https://safenet.one/api/agents/summarize" | jq '.data'
```

### Get User Summary (all holdings, DCA strategies, Polymarket positions)

Returns a single structured snapshot of everything relevant to the authenticated user — ideal for feeding as context to another agent.

```bash
curl -s -H "x-api-key: $NOYA_API_KEY" \
  "https://safenet.one/api/user/summary" | jq '.data'
```

Response includes:
- `holdings` — all wallet tokens and DeFi app positions with USD values
- `dcaStrategies` — all DCA strategies (active, inactive, errored, completed)
- `polymarket.openPositions` — current open prediction market positions with PnL
- `polymarket.closedPositions` — 20 most recently closed positions

### Set System Message (OpenClaw)

Injects a system message into a thread before the conversation starts. **OpenClaw should call this for every new chat** to hand off conversation context to Noya, making the transition feel seamless for the user.

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://safenet.one/api/openclaw/system-message" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $NOYA_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "threadId": "THREAD_ID_HERE",
    "content": "The user has been chatting with OpenClaw and now wants help with crypto tasks. Context from our conversation: ... Please continue assisting them naturally."
  }'
```

**Request body:**
- `threadId` (string, required) — The thread ID to attach the system message to
- `content` (string, required) — Conversation context framed as a handoff from OpenClaw to Noya

**Response:**
- `success` (boolean) — Whether the operation succeeded
- `filtered` (boolean) — Whether the content was sanitized by the security filter
- `message` (string, optional) — Present if content was sanitized

**Errors:**
- `400` — Invalid request or content rejected by security filter (includes `reason`)
- `401` — Unauthorized (invalid API key)

### Chat Completion (OpenAI-compatible, no agent tools)

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://safenet.one/api/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $NOYA_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"sessionId": "SESSION_ID", "message": "Hello, what can you do?"}'
```

### Get Session History

```bash
curl -s -H "x-api-key: $NOYA_API_KEY" \
  "https://safenet.one/api/chat/session/SESSION_ID" | jq '.messages'
```

### Clear Session

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE -H "x-api-key: $NOYA_API_KEY" \
  "https://safenet.one/api/chat/session/SESSION_ID"
```

## Common Patterns

### Check Portfolio
```
User: "What's in my wallet?"

1. Generate a thread ID: uuidgen | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
2. bash {baseDir}/noya-message.sh "What tokens do I have in my portfolio?" "$THREAD_ID"
→ Returns wallet address, token balances, and portfolio data
```

### Token Swap
```
User: "Swap 0.5 ETH to USDC"

1. Generate a thread ID
2. bash {baseDir}/noya-message.sh "Swap 0.5 ETH to USDC" "$THREAD_ID"
→ Noya prepares the swap, asks for confirmation (interrupt), then executes.
   All gas fees are sponsored. User must confirm before execution.
3. bash {baseDir}/noya-message.sh "Yes" "$THREAD_ID"  # after user confirms
```

### Token Analysis
```
User: "Analyze SOL for me"

1. Generate a thread ID
2. bash {baseDir}/noya-message.sh "Give me a detailed analysis of SOL" "$THREAD_ID"
→ Returns price data, market trends, and analysis
```

### DCA Strategy
```
User: "Set up a DCA for ETH"

1. Generate a thread ID
2. bash {baseDir}/noya-message.sh "Set up a weekly DCA strategy for ETH with $50" "$THREAD_ID"
→ Noya configures the DCA strategy and confirms details
```

### Prediction Markets
```
User: "What are the top Polymarket events?"

1. Generate a thread ID
2. bash {baseDir}/noya-message.sh "Show me the top trending Polymarket events" "$THREAD_ID"
→ Returns current events, markets, and trading options
```

### Full User Context for Another Agent
```
Use case: You need to brief another AI agent on everything about the user
before delegating a task to it.

1. curl -s -H "x-api-key: $NOYA_API_KEY" \
     "https://safenet.one/api/user/summary" | jq '.data' > user_context.json
2. Pass user_context.json as the system/user context to the downstream agent.
→ Returns wallet holdings, all DCA strategies, open and closed Polymarket
  positions in a single JSON object. Partial failures are isolated — the
  response always returns whatever data is available, with an error field
  for any source that failed.
```

### Voice Chat
```
User: "I want to talk to Noya"

1. Generate a thread ID
2. Call set system message endpoint with conversation context (step 2.5)
3. open "https://agent.noya.ai?mode=voice&threadIdToUse=$THREAD_ID"
→ Opens voice chat with OpenClaw's conversation context already loaded

User: "Start a fresh voice chat with Noya, no context needed"

1. open "https://agent.noya.ai?mode=voice"
→ Opens voice chat without any prior context (only when user explicitly requests)
```

## Important Notes

### Transaction Confirmation
Noya always asks for user confirmation before executing on-chain transactions (swaps, bridges, transfers, orders). The response will include a `[REQUIRES INPUT]` section with details and options. Always relay this to the user and send their answer as a follow-up in the same thread. Never auto-confirm transactions.

### Wallet Delegation (Website Only)
If Noya responds with a **delegation request**, the user must complete this on the website:
```
"To delegate your wallet, visit https://agent.noya.ai and click
'Delegate Wallet' in the chat. This is a one-time action."
```

### Safe Deployment (Website Only)
If Noya responds with a **Safe deployment request**, the user must complete this on the website:
```
"To deploy your Polymarket Safe, visit https://agent.noya.ai and click
'Deploy Safe Now'. This is free, takes ~30 seconds, and only needs to be done once."
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `401 Unauthorized` | API key is invalid, expired, or revoked. Generate a new one at agent.noya.ai |
| `400 Bad Request` | Missing `message` or `threadId` in request body |
| `429 Rate limit` | Wait a few minutes. Limit is 15 requests per 5-minute window |

## Scripts

This skill includes the following script in its directory:

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `noya-message.sh` | Send a message to the Noya agent and parse the streamed response. Usage: `bash {baseDir}/noya-message.sh "<message>" "<threadId>"` |
