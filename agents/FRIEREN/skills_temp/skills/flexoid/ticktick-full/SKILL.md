description: Operate TickTick through the `ticktick` command-line interface, including authentication, read/query flows, and safe mutations for tasks, projects, folders, columns, tags, habits, user info, focus analytics, and sync payloads. Use when users ask to run TickTick terminal commands, parse TickTick CLI JSON output, resolve IDs, or fix TickTick CLI configuration/auth failures.

# TickTick CLI

Use this skill to execute TickTick workflows directly from terminal commands with deterministic output handling.

## Execution Policy

1. Execute the requested `ticktick ...` command first. Do not run version or tool-presence pre-checks.
2. If execution fails because CLI is missing, load `references/setup-and-auth.md` and follow install recovery flow.
3. If execution fails due auth/config issues, load `references/setup-and-auth.md` and run guided auth before retrying the original command.
4. Keep auth recovery CLI-only. Do not improvise custom SDK/Python token exchange scripts.
5. Use `--help` only as recovery when a command fails due unknown flags/arguments or missing required params.

## Defaults

- Prefer `--json` on all data commands and parse structured output.
- Resolve names to IDs before mutations; never guess identifiers.
- Apply read -> mutate -> verify for every write operation.
- Prefer explicit `--project PROJECT_ID` for task mutations when deterministic behavior matters.
- Use explicit date formats (`YYYY-MM-DD` for date-only fields, ISO datetime for timed fields).

## Safety

- Require explicit user confirmation before install/environment changes.
- Never use risky system-install flags unless the user explicitly asks for that path.
- Never print secrets or tokens in user-visible output.
- Require explicit user confirmation before destructive operations:
  - `tasks delete`
  - `projects delete`
  - `folders delete`
  - `columns delete`
  - `tags delete`
  - `tags merge`
  - `habits delete`
