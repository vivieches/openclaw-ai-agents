# OpenClaw Security Monitor

Proactive security monitoring, threat scanning, and real-time visibility for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclawai/openclaw) deployments. Detects threats from the **ClawHavoc** campaign (824+ malicious skills), **AMOS stealer**, **Vidar infostealer**, **ClawJacked** WebSocket brute-force, supply chain attacks, memory poisoning, log poisoning, SSRF, **13+ CVEs**, and **20+ GHSAs**.

## Why This Exists

In late January 2026, security researchers found that **12% of all ClawHub skills were malicious** — 341 out of 2,857 skills across multiple campaigns. By mid-February, this expanded to **824+ malicious skills** with **1,184 malicious packages** across 12 publisher accounts (Antiy CERT). The Snyk ToxicSkills study found **36% of all ClawHub skills contain security flaws** (3,984 scanned).

The primary campaign, ClawHavoc, delivered the Atomic Stealer (AMOS) macOS infostealer targeting crypto wallets, SSH credentials, and browser passwords. In February, Hudson Rock discovered **Vidar infostealer variants specifically targeting OpenClaw agent identities** — stealing openclaw.json, device.json, soul.md, and memory.md files.

Meanwhile, CVE-2026-25253 demonstrated that a single malicious link could achieve full remote code execution on any OpenClaw instance through WebSocket hijacking — even those bound to localhost. The **ClawJacked** attack (Feb 26, Oasis Security) showed that malicious websites can brute-force localhost WebSocket passwords with no rate limiting. **CVE-2026-28363** (CVSS 9.9) revealed a critical safeBins bypass via GNU long-option abbreviations. In total, **13+ CVEs and 20+ GHSAs** have been disclosed including SSRF, exec bypass, ACP auto-approval bypass, webhook forgery, log poisoning, and more.

**135,000+ instances** are exposed across 82 countries, with **12,812 exploitable via RCE**. Major security firms including CrowdStrike, Bitdefender, Palo Alto Networks, Cisco, and Kaspersky have issued advisories. Meta has banned OpenClaw from corporate devices.

This project provides defense-in-depth monitoring for self-hosted OpenClaw installations. **Minimum safe version: v2026.2.26**.

## Remediation Guide

Step-by-step hardening for each security check, covering both macOS and Linux.

### Check 1: C2 Infrastructure — Known C2 IPs in skill code

**Severity:** CRITICAL

**What it means:** A skill contains IP addresses associated with known command-and-control servers (e.g., `91.92.242.30`). This strongly indicates the skill is malicious.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Identify the affected skill
grep -rlE "91\.92\.242|95\.92\.242|54\.91\.154\.110" ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/

# Remove the malicious skill
openclaw skill remove <skill-name>

# Or manually delete it
rm -rf ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/<skill-name>

# Verify removal
grep -rlE "91\.92\.242" ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/ # should return empty
```

### Check 2: AMOS Stealer / AuthTool Markers

**Severity:** CRITICAL

**What it means:** A skill contains patterns associated with the Atomic Stealer (AMOS) macOS infostealer, NovaStealer, or the "AuthTool" social engineering binary.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Remove the malicious skill immediately
openclaw skill remove <skill-name>

# Check if AMOS was executed (macOS)
# Look for suspicious LaunchAgents
ls ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ | grep -ivE "com\.apple|com\.openclaw\.security"

# Check for unexpected login items (macOS)
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to get the name of every login item'

# Check browser extensions were not tampered with
ls ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions/

# If AMOS was executed: rotate ALL credentials (SSH, AWS, crypto wallets, browser passwords)
```

### Check 3: Reverse Shells & Backdoors

**Severity:** CRITICAL

**What it means:** A skill contains reverse shell patterns (`nc -e`, `/dev/tcp/`, `socat exec`, etc.) or Gatekeeper bypass commands (`xattr -cr`).

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Remove the skill
openclaw skill remove <skill-name>

# Check for active reverse shells (macOS/Linux)
lsof -i -nP | grep -E "ESTABLISHED|SYN_SENT" | grep -vE ":443 |:80 |:53 "

# Kill any suspicious connections
kill -9 <PID>

# Re-enable Gatekeeper if bypassed (macOS)
sudo spctl --master-enable
sudo defaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSQuarantine -bool true

# Check for quarantine removals (macOS)
xattr -l /Applications/*.app | grep quarantine
```

### Check 4: Credential Exfiltration Endpoints

**Severity:** CRITICAL

**What it means:** A skill sends data to known exfiltration services (webhook.site, pipedream.net, ngrok.io, etc.).

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Remove the skill
openclaw skill remove <skill-name>

# Block exfiltration domains at the host level
# macOS/Linux:
sudo sh -c 'echo "127.0.0.1 webhook.site" >> /etc/hosts'
sudo sh -c 'echo "127.0.0.1 pipedream.net" >> /etc/hosts'
sudo sh -c 'echo "127.0.0.1 hookbin.com" >> /etc/hosts'
sudo sh -c 'echo "127.0.0.1 requestbin.com" >> /etc/hosts'

# Flush DNS cache (macOS)
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache && sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
# Flush DNS cache (Linux)
sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches
```

### Check 5: Crypto Wallet Targeting

**Severity:** WARNING

**What it means:** A skill references crypto wallet private keys, seed phrases, or exchange API keys.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Remove the skill
openclaw skill remove <skill-name>

# Move crypto wallets to hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor)
# Rotate exchange API keys immediately

# Restrict filesystem access (macOS)
chmod 700 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Phantom
chmod 700 ~/Library/Application\ Support/MetaMask

# Check if wallet files were accessed recently
# macOS:
mdls -name kMDItemLastUsedDate ~/Library/Application\ Support/Phantom/*
# Linux:
stat -c "%x" ~/.config/phantom/*
```

### Check 6: Curl-Pipe Attacks

**Severity:** WARNING

**What it means:** A skill uses `curl | sh` or `wget | bash` patterns to download and execute remote scripts.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Remove the skill
openclaw skill remove <skill-name>

# Review and restrict agent tool access
openclaw config set tools.deny '["exec","process"]'

# Block curl-pipe at the shell level (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
# This creates an alias that warns on pipe-to-shell patterns:
alias curl='() { if [[ "$*" == *"|"*"sh"* ]] || [[ "$*" == *"|"*"bash"* ]]; then echo "BLOCKED: curl-pipe detected"; return 1; fi; command curl "$@"; }'
```

### Check 7: File Permission Audit

**Severity:** WARNING

**What it means:** Sensitive configuration files (openclaw.json, auth-profiles.json) are readable by other users.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Fix permissions (macOS/Linux)
chmod 600 ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
chmod 600 ~/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/auth-profiles.json
chmod 600 ~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json
chmod 700 ~/.openclaw

# Set default umask in shell profile (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
echo 'umask 077' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### Check 8: Skill Integrity Hashes

**Severity:** WARNING

**What it means:** SKILL.md files have been modified since the last scan, which could indicate tampering or supply chain compromise.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Review what changed
diff ~/.openclaw/logs/skill-hashes.sha256.prev ~/.openclaw/logs/skill-hashes.sha256

# For each changed skill, inspect the diff
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/<skill-name>
git diff HEAD~1 SKILL.md   # If under version control

# If change is unexpected, reinstall from ClawHub
openclaw skill remove <skill-name>
openclaw skill install <skill-name>

# Enable skill pinning (if supported)
openclaw config set skills.autoUpdate false
```

### Check 9: SKILL.md Shell Injection

**Severity:** WARNING

**What it means:** A SKILL.md contains suspicious install instructions that try to get the user or agent to run shell commands (Snyk CVE-2026-22708).

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Review the suspicious SKILL.md
cat ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md | grep -iE "terminal|curl|wget|install|download"

# Remove the skill if instructions are clearly malicious
openclaw skill remove <skill-name>

# Never run commands from SKILL.md Prerequisites without reviewing them first
# Configure agent to not auto-execute installation commands
openclaw config set tools.deny '["exec"]'
```

### Check 10: Memory Poisoning

**Severity:** CRITICAL

**What it means:** SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, or IDENTITY.md contain prompt injection patterns ("ignore previous instructions", "you are now", etc.).

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Review poisoned files
cat ~/.openclaw/workspace/SOUL.md
cat ~/.openclaw/workspace/MEMORY.md
cat ~/.openclaw/workspace/IDENTITY.md

# Remove injected content manually (edit the file, remove injected lines)
# Or restore from backup:
git checkout HEAD -- ~/.openclaw/workspace/SOUL.md

# Protect memory files from modification
chmod 444 ~/.openclaw/workspace/SOUL.md
chmod 444 ~/.openclaw/workspace/MEMORY.md
chmod 444 ~/.openclaw/workspace/IDENTITY.md

# Investigate which skill wrote to memory
grep -rl "SOUL\.md\|MEMORY\.md" ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/
```

### Check 11: Base64 Obfuscation

**Severity:** WARNING

**What it means:** A skill uses base64 encoding/decoding, which is a common technique to hide malicious payloads (as seen in the ClawHavoc campaign via glot.io).

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Review the base64 content
grep -rn "base64" ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/<skill-name>/

# Decode and inspect the payload
echo "<base64-string>" | base64 -d

# Remove if malicious
openclaw skill remove <skill-name>

# Monitor for base64 activity in agent logs
grep -i "base64" ~/.openclaw/logs/*.log
```

### Check 12: External Binary Downloads

**Severity:** WARNING

**What it means:** A skill references downloadable binaries (.exe, .dmg, .pkg, .zip with password) or known malicious download URLs.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Remove the skill
openclaw skill remove <skill-name>

# Check Downloads folder for suspicious binaries (macOS)
ls -la ~/Downloads/*.{exe,dmg,pkg,zip,msi} 2>/dev/null

# Verify Gatekeeper is active (macOS)
spctl --status  # should say "assessments enabled"

# Check if any unsigned apps were installed (macOS)
sudo find /Applications -name "*.app" -exec codesign -v {} \; 2>&1 | grep "invalid"

# Linux: check /tmp and /var/tmp for suspicious downloads
find /tmp /var/tmp -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.elf" -o -name "*.bin" -mtime -7 2>/dev/null
```

### Check 13: Gateway Security Configuration

**Severity:** CRITICAL

**What it means:** The OpenClaw gateway is bound to LAN (accessible from network) or has authentication disabled.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Bind gateway to localhost only
openclaw config set gateway.bind localhost

# Enable authentication
openclaw config set gateway.auth.mode token
# Or use OIDC (enterprise)
openclaw config set gateway.auth.mode oidc

# Verify configuration
openclaw config get gateway.bind
openclaw config get gateway.auth.mode

# Check what's actually listening
lsof -i :18789 -nP   # Should show 127.0.0.1, not 0.0.0.0

# Update to latest version to patch CVE-2026-25253
openclaw update
```

### Check 14: WebSocket Security (CVE-2026-25253)

**Severity:** CRITICAL

**What it means:** The gateway WebSocket accepts connections from arbitrary origins, enabling 1-click RCE via a malicious webpage.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Update OpenClaw to latest version (patch included in 2026.2.3+)
openclaw update

# Verify the fix
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
  -H "Connection: Upgrade" -H "Upgrade: websocket" \
  -H "Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==" \
  -H "Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13" \
  -H "Origin: http://evil.attacker.com" \
  http://127.0.0.1:18789/
# Should return 403 or 401, NOT 101

# If update is not available, restrict gateway to localhost
openclaw config set gateway.bind localhost

# Add firewall rule (macOS)
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /usr/local/bin/node
# Linux (iptables)
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 18789 -s 127.0.0.1 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 18789 -j DROP
```

### Check 15: Malicious Publisher Detection

**Severity:** CRITICAL

**What it means:** An installed skill references a known malicious ClawHub publisher (hightower6eu, zaycv, Ddoy233, etc.).

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Remove all skills from the malicious publisher
openclaw skill remove <skill-name>

# Check for other skills from the same publisher
grep -rl "<publisher-name>" ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/

# Review recently installed skills
ls -lt ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/ | head -20

# Only install skills from verified publishers
# Check skill reputation before installing:
# https://www.koi.ai (Clawdex reputation checker)
```

### Check 16: Sensitive Environment Leakage

**Severity:** WARNING / CRITICAL (if hardcoded API keys found)

**What it means:** A skill reads sensitive files (.env, .ssh, .aws/credentials) or contains hardcoded API keys / Moltbook tokens.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Remove the skill
openclaw skill remove <skill-name>

# Rotate exposed credentials immediately
# OpenAI:
# Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys and regenerate
# Anthropic:
# Go to https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys and regenerate

# Move secrets to a secrets manager instead of .env files
# macOS: Use Keychain Access
security add-generic-password -a "$USER" -s "OPENAI_API_KEY" -w "<new-key>"

# Linux: Use pass or secret-tool
secret-tool store --label="OPENAI_API_KEY" service openai key api

# Restrict skill filesystem access
openclaw config set sandbox.mode all
```

### Check 17: DM Policy Audit

**Severity:** WARNING

**What it means:** A messaging channel has `dmPolicy=open`, allowing anyone to message your agent — enabling social engineering and prompt injection from untrusted sources.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Set DM policy to restricted for each channel
openclaw config set channels.whatsapp.dmPolicy restricted
openclaw config set channels.telegram.dmPolicy restricted
openclaw config set channels.discord.dmPolicy restricted

# Set explicit allowFrom list
openclaw config set channels.telegram.allowFrom '["your-user-id"]'

# Disable unused channels entirely
openclaw config set channels.signal.enabled false
```

### Check 18: Tool Policy / Elevated Tools Audit

**Severity:** CRITICAL

**What it means:** Elevated tools are enabled with wildcard access, or the tool deny list is empty — allowing the agent to execute arbitrary commands.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Restrict elevated tools to specific principals
openclaw config set tools.elevated.allowFrom '["your-user-id"]'

# Add dangerous tools to the deny list
openclaw config set tools.deny '["exec","process","browser","filesystem-write"]'

# Require approval for elevated actions
openclaw config set tools.elevated.requireApproval true

# Review current tool permissions
openclaw config get tools
```

### Check 19: Sandbox Configuration

**Severity:** WARNING

**What it means:** Sandboxing is disabled, allowing skills to access the full filesystem and network without restriction.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Enable sandboxing
openclaw config set sandbox.mode all

# Restrict workspace access to read-only where possible
openclaw config set sandbox.workspaceAccess ro

# For Docker deployments (recommended for production):
# Use gVisor runtime for stronger isolation
docker run --runtime=runsc --read-only \
  -v ~/.openclaw:/home/openclaw/.openclaw:ro \
  openclaw/gateway
```

### Check 20: mDNS/Bonjour Exposure

**Severity:** WARNING

**What it means:** mDNS is broadcasting in "full" mode, advertising the gateway's presence, paths, and SSH port to the local network.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Disable mDNS broadcasting
openclaw config set discovery.mdns.mode off

# Or set to minimal (name only, no paths)
openclaw config set discovery.mdns.mode minimal

# Verify mDNS is not broadcasting (macOS)
dns-sd -B _openclaw._tcp local
# Should return no results

# Disable Bonjour for the gateway specifically (macOS)
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist NoMulticastAdvertisements -bool YES
```

### Check 21: Session & Credential Permissions

**Severity:** WARNING

**What it means:** Credential directories, session files, or the OpenClaw home directory have overly permissive permissions.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Fix all permissions at once
chmod 700 ~/.openclaw
chmod 700 ~/.openclaw/credentials 2>/dev/null
chmod 700 ~/.openclaw/agents/*/sessions 2>/dev/null
find ~/.openclaw/credentials -type f -name "*.json" -exec chmod 600 {} \; 2>/dev/null
find ~/.openclaw -name "auth-profiles.json" -exec chmod 600 {} \;

# Verify
ls -la ~/.openclaw/
ls -la ~/.openclaw/credentials/
```

### Check 22: Persistence Mechanisms

**Severity:** WARNING

**What it means:** There are LaunchAgents, cron entries, or systemd services referencing OpenClaw that are not the known security monitor.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# macOS: Review LaunchAgents
ls -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ | grep -iE "openclaw|clawdbot|moltbot"
# Remove unauthorized agents:
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/<suspicious-plist>
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/<suspicious-plist>

# Check system-level LaunchDaemons (requires root)
sudo ls /Library/LaunchDaemons/ | grep -iE "openclaw|clawdbot"

# Linux: Review systemd services
systemctl --user list-units --type=service | grep -iE "openclaw|clawdbot"
# Disable unauthorized services:
systemctl --user disable --now <service-name>

# Review crontab
crontab -l | grep -iE "openclaw|clawdbot|moltbot"
# Edit and remove suspicious entries:
crontab -e
```

### Check 23: Plugin/Extension Security

**Severity:** CRITICAL

**What it means:** An installed extension contains code execution patterns (`eval()`, `exec()`, `child_process`) or references known malicious domains.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# List installed extensions
ls ~/.openclaw/extensions/

# Review suspicious extension code
grep -rn "eval\|exec\|child_process\|fetch(" ~/.openclaw/extensions/<ext-name>/

# Remove the extension
rm -rf ~/.openclaw/extensions/<ext-name>

# Disable extension loading if not needed
openclaw config set extensions.enabled false

# Only install extensions from verified sources
```

### Check 24: Log Redaction Audit

**Severity:** WARNING

**What it means:** Log redaction is disabled (sensitive data like API keys and passwords may appear in plaintext in logs), or log directories are world-readable.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Enable log redaction
openclaw config set logging.redactSensitive true

# Fix log directory permissions
chmod 700 ~/.openclaw/logs
chmod 700 /tmp/openclaw 2>/dev/null

# Verify logs don't contain sensitive data
grep -iE "sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]{10}|password|token.*=" ~/.openclaw/logs/*.log

# Set up log rotation (macOS - newsyslog)
sudo sh -c 'echo "$HOME/.openclaw/logs/*.log 640 7 1000 * J" >> /etc/newsyslog.conf'
# Linux - logrotate
cat > /etc/logrotate.d/openclaw << 'LOGROTATE'
/home/*/.openclaw/logs/*.log {
    weekly
    rotate 4
    compress
    missingok
    notifempty
    create 0600 root root
}
LOGROTATE
```

### Check 25: Reverse Proxy Localhost Trust Bypass

**Severity:** CRITICAL

**What it means:** The gateway is bound to LAN without `trustedProxies` configured, or `dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth` is enabled. External attackers can bypass authentication by appearing as localhost through a reverse proxy (28% of exposed instances had this flaw per Penligent).

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Configure trusted proxies
openclaw config set gateway.trustedProxies '["192.168.1.1"]'

# Never disable device auth
openclaw config set gateway.dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth false

# If using Nginx, ensure X-Forwarded-For is properly set
# In nginx.conf:
# proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
# proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

# Verify
openclaw config get gateway.trustedProxies
```

### Check 26: Exec-Approvals Configuration

**Severity:** CRITICAL

**What it means:** The `exec-approvals.json` allows remote command execution without confirmation. The CVE-2026-25253 exploit chain used `exec.approvals.set` to disable confirmation prompts.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Set exec approvals to deny for non-owner nodes
# Edit ~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json manually:
# Set "security": "deny" for all non-owner nodes
# Set "ask": "always"

# Fix permissions
chmod 600 ~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json

# Verify
cat ~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json | python3 -m json.tool
```

### Check 27: Docker Container Security

**Severity:** CRITICAL

**What it means:** OpenClaw Docker containers are running as root, with Docker socket mounted, or in privileged mode. CVE-2026-24763 was a command injection in the Docker sandbox.

**Remediation:**
```bash

### Check 28: Node.js Version / CVE-2026-21636

**Severity:** WARNING

**What it means:** Node.js version is below 22.12.0 and vulnerable to CVE-2026-21636 (permission model bypass via Unix Domain Sockets), which allows sandbox escape.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# macOS
brew install node@22
# Or update existing
brew upgrade node

# Linux (NodeSource)
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Verify
node --version  # Should be >= v22.12.0
```

### Check 29: Plaintext Credential Detection

**Severity:** WARNING

**What it means:** OpenClaw config or credential files contain plaintext API keys (OpenAI `sk-`, AWS `AKIA`, GitHub `ghp_`, Slack `xoxb-`). The `~/.openclaw` directory is a standard target for infostealers.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# macOS: Move secrets to Keychain
security add-generic-password -a "$USER" -s "OPENAI_API_KEY" -w "<key>"

# Linux: Use pass or secret-tool
pass insert openai/api-key
# Or
secret-tool store --label="OPENAI_API_KEY" service openai key api

# Use environment variables instead of config files
export OPENAI_API_KEY=$(security find-generic-password -s "OPENAI_API_KEY" -w)

# Set up detect-secrets baseline
pip install detect-secrets
detect-secrets scan ~/.openclaw/ > .secrets.baseline
```

### Check 30: VS Code Extension Trojan Detection

**Severity:** CRITICAL

**What it means:** Fake "ClawdBot Agent" VS Code extensions have been discovered that install ScreenConnect RAT and remote access trojans. OpenClaw has NO official VS Code extension.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Remove any clawdbot/openclaw VS Code extensions immediately
rm -rf ~/.vscode/extensions/*clawdbot*
rm -rf ~/.vscode/extensions/*openclaw*
rm -rf ~/.vscode/extensions/*moltbot*

# Check for ScreenConnect/ConnectWise artifacts
# macOS:
find /Applications -name "*ScreenConnect*" -o -name "*ConnectWise*"
# Linux:
find /opt -name "*screenconnect*" -o -name "*connectwise*"

# Scan for persistence left by the trojan
ls ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ | grep -ivE "com\.apple"
```

### Check 31: Internet Exposure Detection

**Severity:** WARNING

**What it means:** The gateway is listening on non-loopback interfaces, potentially exposing it to the internet. Over 21,000 OpenClaw instances were found on Shodan with zero authentication.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Bind to localhost only
openclaw config set gateway.bind localhost

# Verify
lsof -i :18789 -nP | grep LISTEN
# Should show 127.0.0.1:18789, NOT *:18789 or 0.0.0.0:18789

# Add firewall rules (macOS pf)
echo "block in on ! lo0 proto tcp to any port 18789" | sudo pfctl -ef -

# Linux (iptables)
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 18789 ! -s 127.0.0.1 -j DROP

# Change default port (reduce scan surface)
openclaw config set gateway.port 28789
```

### Check 32: MCP Server Security

**Severity:** CRITICAL

**What it means:** MCP servers are configured with unrestricted access (`enableAllProjectMcpServers=true`) or contain prompt injection patterns in tool descriptions — enabling tool poisoning and rug-pull attacks.

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Use explicit MCP server allowlist
openclaw config set mcp.enableAllProjectMcpServers false

# Review each MCP server's tool descriptions
cat ~/.openclaw/mcp.json | python3 -m json.tool

# Pin MCP server versions (prevent rug pulls)
# In mcp.json, use specific versions, not "latest"

# Run MCP servers in separate containers
# Use Cisco MCP Scanner for analysis:
# https://github.com/cisco-ai-defense/mcp-scanner

# Audit MCP server network access
# Check which external endpoints each server contacts
lsof -i -nP | grep -E "node|mcp" | grep ESTABLISHED
```

## Auto-Remediation

The `remediate.sh` orchestrator runs `scan.sh`, parses the results, skips CLEAN checks, and executes per-check remediation scripts for each WARNING/CRITICAL finding.

```bash
# Scan + remediate (interactive)
./scripts/remediate.sh

# Auto-approve all fixes
./scripts/remediate.sh --yes

# Dry run — preview what would be fixed
./scripts/remediate.sh --dry-run

# Remediate a single check
./scripts/remediate.sh --check 7 --dry-run

# Run all 40 scripts without scanning
./scripts/remediate.sh --all
```

### Per-Check Remediation Scripts

Each of the 40 scan checks has a dedicated remediation script in `scripts/remediate/`. Scripts are standalone, support `--yes` and `--dry-run`, and return exit 0 (fixed), 1 (failed), or 2 (nothing to fix).

## IOC Auto-Updater

The `update-ioc.sh` script:
1. Checks upstream GitHub repo for IOC database updates
2. Scans active network connections against known C2 IPs
3. Validates installed skills against malicious publisher and pattern databases
4. Computes file hashes and checks against known malicious hashes

```bash
# Check for updates without applying
./scripts/update-ioc.sh --check-only

# Download and apply updates
./scripts/update-ioc.sh
```

## Web Dashboard

**How this project differs:** openclaw-security-monitor runs *outside* the agent as independent host-level monitoring — it scans the filesystem, network, processes, and gateway configuration directly, without relying on the agent's own tools or trust boundaries. This provides defense-in-depth even if the agent itself is compromised.

## Install as OpenClaw Skill

Deploy directly into the OpenClaw agent's skill directory for in-agent access:

```bash
# From GitHub
git clone https://github.com/adibirzu/openclaw-security-monitor.git \
  ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/<skill-dir>
chmod +x ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/<skill-dir>/scripts/*.sh

Replace `<skill-dir>` with the actual folder name where the skill is installed (commonly `openclaw-security-monitor` or `security-monitor`).
```

The agent auto-discovers skills from `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/` via SKILL.md frontmatter. After installation, these commands are available in the agent:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/security-scan` | Run 32-point security scan |
| `/security-remediate` | Auto-fix common findings |
| `/security-dashboard` | CLI security dashboard |
| `/security-network` | Network connection monitor |
| `/security-setup-telegram` | Configure Telegram alerts |

To verify installation:
```bash
# Check skill is visible
openclaw skills list | grep openclaw-security-monitor

# Test scan through the agent
# In the agent, type: /security-scan
```
