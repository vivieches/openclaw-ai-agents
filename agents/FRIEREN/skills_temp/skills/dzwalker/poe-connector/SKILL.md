# Poe Connector — USE BASH TOOL

**You MUST use the `bash` or `shell` tool to run these commands. No other method works.**

## Commands

Chat with AI:
```bash
bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/poe-connector/poe.sh chat Tell me 10 jokes
```

Generate image:
```bash
bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/poe-connector/poe.sh image A sunset over mountains
```

Generate video:
```bash
bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/poe-connector/poe.sh video A cat playing piano
```

Generate audio:
```bash
bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/poe-connector/poe.sh audio Hello world in a cheerful voice
```

List models:
```bash
bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/poe-connector/poe.sh models
```

Search models:
```bash
bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/poe-connector/poe.sh search claude
```

## DO NOT

- Do NOT use `sessions_spawn` — it will fail
- Do NOT use browser to visit poe.com — it will fail
- Do NOT set poe as a model provider — it will fail
- Do NOT use any approach other than `bash` tool — only bash works

## Setup (required before first use)

This skill requires a Poe API key. Get one at https://poe.com/api/keys, then add to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{ "skills": { "entries": { "poe-connector": { "env": { "POE_API_KEY": "your-key" } } } } }
```

## Notes

- All commands use sensible default models (configured in poe_config.json)
- If you get a POE_API_KEY error, tell the user to run the setup above
- File attachments (--files) are base64-encoded and sent to Poe — do not attach sensitive files unless the user intends to share them with Poe
