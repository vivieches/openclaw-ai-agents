# Agricultural Output Forecasting

> **Version**: 1.0.1  
> **Category**: Agriculture / Analytics  
> **Billing**: SkillPay (1 token per call, ~0.001 USDT)  
> **Free Trial**: 10 free calls per user

A big data-driven agricultural product output forecasting tool that helps farmers, agronomists, and agricultural businesses predict crop yields and production outputs.

## Features

1. **Yield Prediction** - Forecast crop yields based on historical data and current conditions
2. **Weather Impact Analysis** - Factor in weather patterns and climate data
3. **Market Trend Integration** - Consider market prices and demand trends
4. **Multi-Crop Support** - Support for various agricultural products (grains, vegetables, fruits, etc.)
5. **SkillPay Billing** - Pay-per-use monetization (1 token per call, ~0.001 USDT)
6. **Free Trial** - 10 free calls for every new user

## Free Trial

Each user gets **10 free calls** before billing begins. During the trial:
- No payment required
- Full feature access
- Trial status returned in API response

```python
{
    "success": True,
    "trial_mode": True,      # Currently in free trial
    "trial_remaining": 7,    # 7 free calls left
    "balance": None,         # No balance needed in trial
    "forecast": {...}
}
```

After 10 free calls, normal billing applies.

## Quick Start

### Forecast agricultural output:

```python
from scripts.forecast import forecast_output
import os

# Set environment variables (only needed after trial)
os.environ["SKILL_BILLING_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"
os.environ["SKILL_ID"] = "your-skill-id"

# Forecast wheat yield
result = forecast_output(
    crop_type="wheat",
    area_hectares=100,
    region="North China Plain",
    season="spring",
    user_id="user_123"
)

# Check result
if result["success"]:
    print("预测产量:", result["forecast"])
    if result.get("trial_mode"):
        print(f"免费试用剩余: {result['trial_remaining']} 次")
    else:
        print("剩余余额:", result["balance"])
else:
    print("错误:", result["error"])
    if "paymentUrl" in result:
        print("充值链接:", result["paymentUrl"])
```

### API Usage:

```bash
# Set environment variables (only needed after trial)
export SKILL_BILLING_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export SKILL_ID="your-skill-id"

# Run forecast
python scripts/forecast.py \
  --crop wheat \
  --area 100 \
  --region "North China Plain" \
  --season spring \
  --user-id "user_123"
```

## Environment Variables

This skill requires the following environment variables:

| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key for enhanced forecasting | - |
| `CACHE_DURATION_MINUTES` | Cache duration for weather/market data | `60` |
| `MAX_FORECAST_AREA` | Maximum area in hectares per request | `10000` |

See `.env.example` for a complete list of environment variables.

## Configuration

## Output Format

Forecast results include:
- Predicted yield (tons/hectare)
- Confidence interval
- Weather impact factor
- Market price prediction
- Risk assessment
- Recommendations

### Response Format

```python
{
    "success": True,
    "trial_mode": False,        # True during free trial
    "trial_remaining": 0,       # Remaining free calls
    "balance": 95.5,            # User balance (None during trial)
    "forecast": {
        "forecast_id": "AGR_20240306120000",
        "crop_type": "wheat",
        "yield_forecast": {...},
        "risk_assessment": {...},
        "recommendations": [...]
    }
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- Agricultural data is treated as confidential business information
- No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected
- Weather and market data is cached to minimize API calls

### API Key Security
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Rotate API keys regularly
