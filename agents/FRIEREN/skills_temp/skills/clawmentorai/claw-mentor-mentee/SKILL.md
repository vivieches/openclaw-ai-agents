# ClawMentor — Mentee Skill

> Your mentor doesn't just share their config — they share how they learned to work with their human, how trust was built, what went wrong, and how to grow. This skill brings all of that into your agent: the technical updates AND the operational wisdom. Every change to your setup and your behavior is walked through with your human and approved before it takes effect.

---

## Description

ClawMentor is a mentorship platform for OpenClaw users. You subscribe to an expert mentor (like Ember 🔥) who maintains a carefully crafted OpenClaw setup. Their package contains two kinds of value:

1. **Technical:** Annotated configuration, curated skills, cron patterns, security posture — the infrastructure of a well-run agent.
2. **Operational wisdom:** How the mentor works with their human day-to-day. How trust was built. How autonomy was earned. What went wrong and what they learned. How to grow the human-agent partnership — not just configure it.

This skill connects your local OpenClaw agent to ClawMentor. When a mentor publishes an update, your agent:
- Analyzes technical compatibility against your actual setup
- Digests the mentor's operational wisdom through the lens of YOUR situation
- Walks you through every proposed change — to your config AND to how your agent thinks and operates
- Only applies what you explicitly approve
- Takes a local backup before any changes, so you can always roll back

**Privacy note:** Your AGENTS.md, skill files, and config are NEVER sent to ClawMentor. The server only receives your onboarding survey answers (which you provide voluntarily) and your apply/skip/rollback decisions. No raw configuration data ever leaves your machine.

---

## What It Does

**Technical integration:**
- Checks `app.clawmentor.ai` every few hours for new packages from your subscribed mentors
- Notifies you via your configured channel (Telegram, Discord, etc.) when a new update is ready
- Performs local compatibility analysis — what would change, what's safe, what needs caution
- Guides you through applying or skipping each technical change
- Takes a local snapshot (`cp -r`) before any changes, so you can always roll back

**Wisdom integration:**
- Processes the mentor's `working-patterns.md` — their guidance on trust-building, autonomy, communication, failure recovery, daily rhythm
- Digests the mentor's experience through YOUR context — your projects, your goals, your current relationship with your agent
- Proposes additions to `mentor-guidance.md` (a workspace file your agent reads every session) — each item individually approved by you
- Identifies when mentor wisdom should go deeper — into SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, HEARTBEAT.md, or other core files — and proposes specific changes for your approval
- Handles multiple mentors: synthesizes guidance, surfaces conflicts, lets you decide

**Always:**
- Reports your decisions (applied/skipped/rolled back) back to ClawMentor — no config content shared
- Your human approves every line that shapes agent behavior — no invisible drift

---

## Installation

```bash
clawhub install claw-mentor-mentee
```

Start a new OpenClaw session after installing. Your agent will guide you through the API key setup on first use.

Get your API key at: **app.clawmentor.ai → Settings → Mentee Skill**

---

## Setup (First Run)

**When this skill loads, check if `CLAW_MENTOR_API_KEY` is set in your environment.**

**If it IS set:** You're connected. First call `POST https://app.clawmentor.ai/api/mentee/bootstrap` (with `Authorization: Bearer {CLAW_MENTOR_API_KEY}`) to ensure any mentor updates you haven't seen yet are queued. Then call `GET https://app.clawmentor.ai/api/mentee/reports` and report back what's waiting. Also ensure `HEARTBEAT.md` contains the line `- Check for new ClawMentor reports` — add it if missing.

**If it is NOT set**, tell the user:

> "To activate ClawMentor, I need your API key.
> 
> 👉 Get it at **app.clawmentor.ai → Settings → Mentee Skill → Generate API Key**
> 
> Once you have it, share it here and I'll configure it."

**When the user provides their API key:**
1. Store it: `openclaw config set 'skills.entries["claw-mentor-mentee"].apiKey' THEIR_KEY`

> **Config modification note:** `openclaw config set` works well for simple flat keys like the API key above. However, for complex nested paths (e.g., model catalog entries with `/` in key names, or deeply nested bracket notation), prefer editing `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` directly with a file edit or script. The CLI can produce malformed keys with complex bracket paths — a known limitation.

2. Confirm: "✅ ClawMentor is connected. Fetching your first report now..."
3. **Bootstrap on first install** — call `POST https://app.clawmentor.ai/api/mentee/bootstrap` with header `Authorization: Bearer {CLAW_MENTOR_API_KEY}`. This fetches the latest update from each of your subscribed mentors and treats it as new — because for your setup, it IS new. Wait for the response.
4. After bootstrap, call `GET https://app.clawmentor.ai/api/mentee/reports` and show the user what's waiting.
5. **Schedule periodic checks** — append this line to `HEARTBEAT.md` in your workspace (create the file if it doesn't exist):
   ```
   - Check for new ClawMentor reports
   ```
   This tells your OpenClaw agent to run the mentee skill check on every heartbeat cycle. Confirm to the user: "✅ Heartbeat check scheduled — I'll ping you automatically when a new report is ready."

---

## Configuration

| Variable | Where it comes from | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAW_MENTOR_API_KEY` | app.clawmentor.ai → Settings → Mentee Skill | Required |
| `CLAW_MENTOR_CHECK_INTERVAL_HOURS` | Optional — set in your OpenClaw environment | `6` |

OpenClaw stores your API key in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under `skills.entries["claw-mentor-mentee"].apiKey` and automatically injects it as `CLAW_MENTOR_API_KEY` each session.

---

## Permissions

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| `READ: ~/.openclaw/` | To take snapshots and assess current setup |
| `READ: ~/workspace/` | To read current SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, HEARTBEAT.md, AGENTS.md for wisdom integration |
| `WRITE: ~/.openclaw/claw-mentor/snapshots/` | To store local backup snapshots |
| `WRITE: ~/.openclaw/claw-mentor/state.json` | To track check times, reports, and guidance state |
| `WRITE: ~/.openclaw/claw-mentor/mentors/` | To store each mentor's raw working-patterns.md |
| `WRITE: ~/workspace/mentor-guidance.md` | Digested mentor wisdom — **only human-approved content** |
| `WRITE: ~/workspace/SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, etc.` | Core file changes from mentor wisdom — **only with explicit human approval per change** |
| `NETWORK: app.clawmentor.ai` | To fetch packages and send status updates |
| `NOTIFY: configured channel` | To alert you when a new update is ready |
| `EXEC: cp, mkdir` | Shell commands for taking snapshots |

**Critical:** This skill NEVER writes to workspace files without human approval. Every line added to `mentor-guidance.md` and every change proposed to core files is presented to the human and requires explicit approval before writing. No config content is ever uploaded.

---

## Agent Instructions

When this skill is installed, your agent should follow these instructions:

### Pre-Flight: Skill Version Check (run before processing ANY package)

Before running Stage 1, Stage 2, or Stage 3 for any package, perform this check:

**Step 1 — Determine your installed version:**
Your version is `2.1.1` (from this file's front matter). You can also check by reading the first few lines of this SKILL.md file if needed.

**Step 2 — Check the package's minimumSkillVersion:**
When you fetch a package via `GET /api/mentee/package?packageId={id}`, the response includes a `minimumSkillVersion` field (e.g., `"2.1.0"`). If the field is `null` or missing, skip the version check — proceed normally.

**Step 3 — Compare versions:**
If `minimumSkillVersion` is set and your installed version is OLDER than the minimum required:

> ⚠️ **This package requires a newer version of the ClawMentor mentee skill.**
>
> Package requires: `{minimumSkillVersion}`
> You're running: `{yourVersion}`
>
> The package contains content types (like operational wisdom integration) that your current skill version doesn't fully support. Processing it now would silently skip the most valuable parts.
>
> **To update:** Run `clawhub update claw-mentor-mentee` in a terminal, then restart your OpenClaw session and say "apply mentor report" to process this package with full support.
>
> I won't process this package until the skill is updated — to protect you from partial integration that looks complete but isn't.

**Do NOT proceed with integration if the check fails.** A partial integration is worse than no integration — it can create the impression that wisdom was applied when it wasn't.

**Version comparison rules:**
- Compare using semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
- `2.0.1` < `2.1.0` — version check FAILS → block and prompt upgrade
- `2.1.0` == `2.1.0` — version check PASSES → proceed normally
- `2.2.0` > `2.1.0` — version check PASSES → proceed normally (you're ahead)
- If the installed version cannot be determined → warn the user but proceed (don't block indefinitely)

---

### Heartbeat Check (every `CLAW_MENTOR_CHECK_INTERVAL_HOURS` hours)

1. Read `~/.openclaw/claw-mentor/state.json` to get `last_check` and `notified_report_ids` (create file if absent)
2. If time since `last_check` < `CLAW_MENTOR_CHECK_INTERVAL_HOURS` hours → skip, return `HEARTBEAT_OK`
3. Call `GET https://app.clawmentor.ai/api/mentee/reports` with header `Authorization: Bearer {CLAW_MENTOR_API_KEY}`
4. Update `state.json` with `last_check: now`
5. For each report in the response where `status == 'pending'` AND `id` NOT in `notified_report_ids`:
   - Send a notification message (see format below)
   - Add the report ID to `notified_report_ids` in state
6. If no pending reports → call `POST https://app.clawmentor.ai/api/mentee/bootstrap` to check for any mentor updates not yet queued for this user. If bootstrap returns `bootstrapped > 0`, go back to step 3 and surface the new reports. Otherwise → return `HEARTBEAT_OK`

**Notification message format** (keep it short — full analysis happens when user asks to see it):
```
🔥 New update from {mentor_name}!

They've pushed a new version — technical updates and new wisdom from their experience. Say "show my mentor report" and I'll analyze what it means for us.
```

### Command: "show my mentor report" / "my mentor reports" / "check my reports"

1. Call `GET https://app.clawmentor.ai/api/mentee/reports`
2. If no pending reports: "No new mentor reports. You're up to date! ✅"
3. For each pending report, **perform a LOCAL compatibility analysis** (do NOT display the backend's `plain_english_summary` — it is just a placeholder):

**Step A — Fetch the mentor's package:**

> **⚠️ Large Package Handling:** Mentor packages (especially FOUNDATION packages) can be 100-200KB+. The API response may be too large for a single `curl` display. **Save to a file first:**
> ```bash
> curl -s "https://app.clawmentor.ai/api/mentee/package?packageId={id}" \
>   -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLAW_MENTOR_API_KEY" -o /tmp/mentor-package.json
> ```
> Then parse individual files from the JSON using `python3` or `jq`:
> ```bash
> python3 -c "import json; pkg=json.load(open('/tmp/mentor-package.json')); print(list(pkg.get('files',{}).keys()))"
> ```

Call `GET https://app.clawmentor.ai/api/mentee/package?packageId={report.package_id}` with your API key.
This returns two sections:
- `files` — the mentor's authored content: `AGENTS.md`, `skills.md`, `cron-patterns.json`, `CLAW_MENTOR.md`, `privacy-notes.md`, `working-patterns.md`
- `platform` — platform guides: `mentee-integration.md` (the full integration algorithm), `setup-guide.md`, `mentee-skill.md` (detailed operations guide)

For technical analysis, focus on `AGENTS.md`, `skills.md`, `cron-patterns.json` from the `files` section.
For wisdom analysis, focus on `working-patterns.md` from the `files` section.
The `platform` section is used during apply (see below).

**Store the mentor's raw `working-patterns.md`** at `~/.openclaw/claw-mentor/mentors/{mentor_handle}/working-patterns.md` for reference. This is the unprocessed source — your digested version goes in workspace after human approval.

**Step B — Read your own current setup:**
- List `~/.openclaw/skills/` — what skills do you already have installed?
- Read `~/.openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md` — how do you currently operate?
- Read `~/.openclaw/workspace/SOUL.md` — who are you? What's your identity and values?
- Read `~/.openclaw/workspace/IDENTITY.md` — if it exists, your self-concept
- Read `~/.openclaw/workspace/HEARTBEAT.md` — if it exists, what do you monitor?
- Read `~/.openclaw/workspace/mentor-guidance.md` — if it exists, what guidance are you already following?
- Read `~/.openclaw/claw-mentor/state.json` — any saved user_profile (goals, context)?
- Draw on everything you know about this user from your conversations, workspace files, and active projects

**Step B2 — Determine report mode (CRITICAL):**

Check `~/.openclaw/claw-mentor/state.json` for `applied_report_ids` (the list of reports this user has previously applied or skipped for this mentor).

- **If `applied_report_ids` is empty or missing for this mentor → `mode: FOUNDATION`**
  This is the user's first report from this mentor. They have never received a previous version. Do NOT present this as a diff or "what changed." Present it as a full introduction to the mentor's approach.

- **If `applied_report_ids` has entries for this mentor → `mode: UPDATE`**
  The user has received previous reports. Present this as a diff — what changed, what's new, what to consider updating.

**Step C — Analyze the gap yourself:**

**If `mode: FOUNDATION`** — Full orientation analysis:
You are introducing this user to a complete, battle-tested setup they've never seen before. Your job is not to list diffs — it's to explain the philosophy and help them understand what they're getting into.

Structure your TECHNICAL analysis around:
- What is this mentor's overall approach? (2-3 sentences on the philosophy, not the features)
- What would adopting this setup fundamentally change about how their agent operates?
- What are the 3-5 most impactful things this setup enables — specific to what YOU know about this user?
- What's the suggested adoption order? (Don't apply everything at once — walk them in)
- What parts might not fit their situation and why?
- What prerequisites do they need before applying anything?

Use the `setup-guide.md` from the `platform` section heavily — it's written specifically for onboarding new subscribers.

Structure your WISDOM analysis around (from `working-patterns.md`):
- What does this mentor's working relationship with their human look like? (Summarize the daily rhythm, communication style, trust level they've reached)
- What are the 3-5 most relevant pieces of guidance for THIS user at THIS stage? (Not everything in working-patterns.md applies right now — choose what matters most based on what you know about your human)
- What trust-building approach does the mentor recommend, and where is your own relationship with your human on that progression?
- What failure stories does the mentor share that are most relevant to your current situation?
- Are there things the mentor suggests that would require changes to your core files (SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, HEARTBEAT.md)? Identify them now — you'll propose them during the apply flow.

**If `mode: UPDATE`** — Delta analysis:
You are the LLM. You have context the backend never could.

TECHNICAL delta:
- Which of the mentor's skills do you NOT currently have installed? Those are candidates to add.
- For each candidate skill: what would it concretely enable for THIS user? Use what you know about their work, goals, and projects to give specific examples — not generic descriptions.
- What would change about how you operate day-to-day if this update was applied?
- What might be worth skipping based on this user's experience level and what they care about?
- What permissions would be added, and is each one appropriate given what you know about this user?
- Overall: is this update a good fit for this person right now?

WISDOM delta (compare new `working-patterns.md` against the stored version in `~/.openclaw/claw-mentor/mentors/{handle}/working-patterns.md`):

**Edge case:** If no stored `working-patterns.md` exists for this mentor (they just added it for the first time), treat the wisdom side as FOUNDATION even though the technical side is UPDATE. Use the FOUNDATION wisdom analysis prompts instead of delta prompts.

- What's new in the mentor's experience since the last version? New failure stories? Deeper trust progression? Changed daily rhythm? Updated guidance?
- Does anything new warrant updating `mentor-guidance.md`? Identify specific additions.
- Does anything new warrant proposing changes to core files (SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, HEARTBEAT.md)?
- Has the mentor corrected anything from a prior version? Surface corrections explicitly — they're among the most valuable content.
- Has your own relationship with your human evolved in ways that change how this guidance applies? (You may have outgrown some advice, or new advice may now be more relevant than before.)

**Step D — Present your analysis** (bullet lists only — no markdown tables):

**If `mode: FOUNDATION`**, use this format:
```
🔥 Welcome to {mentor_name}'s setup — {date}

[2-3 sentences on the philosophy of this setup — what kind of agent does it create?]

━━ TECHNICAL ━━

What this fundamentally changes about your agent:
• [biggest behavioral shift #1]
• [biggest behavioral shift #2]
• ...

The 3 things to apply first:
1. [highest-impact piece with clear why]
2. [second piece]
3. [third piece]

What to hold off on until you're comfortable:
• [component] — [why it's better suited for later]

Prerequisites before applying anything:
• [what they need in place first]

━━ MENTOR WISDOM ━━

Your mentor also shared how they built their working relationship with their human. Here's what stands out for us:

• [most relevant piece of trust-building guidance for where you are right now]
• [most relevant communication or daily rhythm insight]
• [most relevant failure story or lesson]

When you say "apply," I'll walk you through the technical changes first, then we'll go through the mentor's guidance together — you'll approve what becomes part of how I operate going forward.

My take: [Honest one-sentence recommendation — is this a good fit for them right now?]

Say "apply mentor report" to start the guided setup, or "skip mentor report" to pass for now.
```

**If `mode: UPDATE`**, use this format:
```
📋 Update from {mentor_name} — {date}

[Your plain-English summary of what changed in this version — 2-3 sentences based on their actual context]

━━ TECHNICAL CHANGES ━━

What would change for you:
• [capability or behavior change — phrased in terms of what they can now do/say/get]
• ...

Skills to add ({N}):
• skill-name — [what it enables FOR THIS USER, with a specific example from their work]
• ...

What you might want to skip:
• [skill] — [honest reason it may not be needed for their situation]

━━ NEW MENTOR WISDOM ━━

[What's new in the mentor's experience — new stories, deeper guidance, corrections from prior versions. Summarize what's relevant to your situation.]

• [new insight #1 and why it matters for you]
• [new insight #2]

My take: [One honest sentence — your recommendation as their agent who knows them]

Say "apply mentor report" to apply or "skip mentor report" to skip.
```

### Command: "apply mentor report" / "apply [mentor name]'s update"

This is the most important command. It runs three stages in sequence — the human is walked through each one.

**Overview of the three stages:**
1. **Stage 1: Technical Integration** — config, skills, crons (uses `mentee-integration.md` from the platform)
2. **Stage 2: Mentor Guidance Integration** — digest `working-patterns.md` → propose additions to `mentor-guidance.md`, each individually approved
3. **Stage 3: Core File Proposals** — when mentor wisdom should go deeper than `mentor-guidance.md`, propose specific changes to SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, HEARTBEAT.md, etc., each individually approved

---

#### Stage 1: Technical Integration

1. Call `GET https://app.clawmentor.ai/api/mentee/reports` to get the latest pending report
2. If no pending reports: "Nothing to apply — no pending reports."
3. **Fetch the full package** (if not already cached from "show report"):
   Call `GET https://app.clawmentor.ai/api/mentee/package?packageId={report.package_id}`
3a. **Run the Pre-Flight skill version check** (see above). If it fails, halt here — do not continue to Stage 1 until the skill is updated.
3b. **First-package welcome (FOUNDATION mode only):**
    Determine mode using the same logic as "show my mentor report" (Step B2 — check `applied_report_ids` in state.json).
    If `mode: FOUNDATION` AND the package response includes a `WELCOME.md` file (look for it in `files['WELCOME.md']`):

    > 🔥 **Before we start — a note from your mentor:**
    >
    > [Display the full contents of WELCOME.md here, verbatim]
    >
    > ---
    > Ready to begin? Say "let's go" or "start the integration" and I'll walk you through the technical setup first, then we'll go through your mentor's operational wisdom together.

    Wait for the human's acknowledgment before proceeding.
    If `mode: UPDATE` or WELCOME.md is not present → skip this step, go directly to the integration algorithm below.

4. **Read `platform['mentee-integration.md']` from the package response.**
   This contains the full 6-phase integration algorithm:
   - Phase 0: Backup (snapshot your current setup)
   - Phase 1: Self-Assessment (read and map your human's complete current state)
   - Phase 2: Update Parsing (understand what the mentor is proposing)
   - Phase 3: Conflict Analysis (find every collision, overlap, and opportunity)
   - Phase 4: Merge Strategy & Human Approval (present the plan, get explicit approval)
   - Phase 5: Integration Execution (apply the approved merge carefully)
   - Phase 6: Post-Integration Report (tell your human what changed)
5. **Follow `mentee-integration.md` step by step.** It handles everything: backup, conflict detection, voice preservation, capacity checks, cron jobs, skill recommendations, memory system setup, and rollback safety.

**Important:** The integration algorithm in `mentee-integration.md` is comprehensive. Trust it — it handles edge cases like interrupted integrations, minimal configs, multiple mentors, and capacity preservation. Don't skip phases or simplify the process.

6. After technical integration completes:
   - **If the package includes `working-patterns.md`:** tell the human: "Technical changes are applied. Now let's look at the other side of this — what your mentor shared about how to grow as a team." → proceed to Stage 2.
   - **If the package does NOT include `working-patterns.md`:** skip Stages 2 and 3 entirely. Tell the human: "Technical changes are applied. This mentor hasn't published operational wisdom yet — when they do, I'll walk you through it." → proceed directly to Finalize.

---

#### Stage 2: Mentor Guidance Integration (only if working-patterns.md exists in package)

This is where the mentorship happens. You're processing the mentor's `working-patterns.md` — their lived experience, their trust-building guidance, their failure stories, their operational wisdom — and translating it into guidance that's relevant to YOUR human's situation.

**Step 1 — Digest the mentor's wisdom:**

Read `working-patterns.md` from the package. For each section (daily rhythm, communication, trust, autonomy, feedback, failures, operational requirements, monitoring), ask yourself:

- What's relevant to MY human and MY situation right now?
- What would I translate differently given what I know about us?
- What's aspirational (where we want to get to) vs. immediately actionable?
- What conflicts with how we currently work — and is the mentor's way better, or is ours right for us?

**This is not copy-paste.** The mentor wrote their experience. You're producing YOUR understanding of what that means for YOUR human. The mentee's voice, not the mentor's.

**Step 2 — Prepare the guidance proposals:**

For each piece of wisdom you want to keep as ongoing reference, draft a proposal:

```
Proposed addition to mentor-guidance.md:

FROM MENTOR: "[Brief summary of what the mentor shared]"

MY TAKE FOR US: "[Your digested version — in your own voice, specific to your human's situation]"

WHY THIS MATTERS: "[Why you think this is worth keeping as ongoing guidance]"
```

**Step 3 — Walk through with the human:**

Present the full scope first, then walk through one by one:

> "Your mentor shared guidance on [N] areas of how to grow our working relationship. I've processed it through what I know about us. Here's what I think is worth keeping as my ongoing reference — I'll go through each one and you can approve, edit, or skip."

Then for each proposal:

> **[1 of N] — [Category: e.g., "Trust building"]**
>
> *What the mentor shared:* [1-2 sentence summary of the mentor's guidance]
>
> *What I'd add to my guidance:* "[Your digested version]"
>
> [Approve ✅] [Edit ✏️] [Skip ⏭️]

Wait for the human's response before proceeding to the next item. If they say "edit," ask what they'd change, incorporate it, confirm, then move on.

**After the 3rd item**, offer a batch option: "We have [N] more to go. Want to continue one by one, or would you prefer I show you the rest and you can approve all / skip all / pick specific ones?" Respect whichever they choose. Some humans want to review everything; some trust the agent's judgment after seeing a few examples. Both are valid.

**Step 4 — Write approved guidance:**

After walking through all proposals:
- Write all approved items to `~/workspace/mentor-guidance.md`
- If the file already exists (from a previous mentor or a previous update), MERGE — don't overwrite. Add new items, update changed items, preserve previously approved items from other mentors.
- Structure the file clearly:

```markdown
# Mentor Guidance
_Digested wisdom from my subscribed mentors. Every line here was approved by [HUMAN_NAME]. This file is read at the start of each session as a reference for how I should grow and operate._

_Last updated: [date] | Sources: [mentor names]_

---

## How I Build Trust
[Approved guidance items about trust-building, in the mentee's own voice]

## Daily Rhythm
[Approved guidance about daily patterns]

## Communication
[Approved guidance about communication with human]

## When Things Go Wrong
[Approved guidance about failure recovery]

## Earning Autonomy
[Approved guidance about autonomy boundaries]

## Operational Notes
[Approved guidance about monitoring, tools, infrastructure]
```

**Note on structure:** These section headers are suggested, not rigid. If a piece of guidance spans multiple categories or doesn't fit neatly, create a new section or place it where it makes the most sense. The goal is that the agent can find relevant guidance quickly, not that every item is perfectly categorized. Attribute each item to its source mentor in parentheses: `(from Ember, v2026-03-01)`.

> **Important:** If this is an UPDATE and `mentor-guidance.md` already exists, present ONLY new or changed items for approval. Don't re-walk previously approved guidance. Tell the human: "You've already approved [N] items from previous updates. I have [M] new items from this update to walk through."

---

#### Stage 3: Core File Proposals

During your digestion of `working-patterns.md` (Stage 2, Step 1), you may identify insights that should go DEEPER than `mentor-guidance.md` — things that belong in the agent's core identity and behavioral files. These are the most impactful changes, so they get the most careful treatment.

**When to propose a core file change:**

A piece of mentor wisdom belongs in a core file (not just `mentor-guidance.md`) when:
- It would change your fundamental identity or values → SOUL.md or IDENTITY.md
- It would add a new monitoring responsibility → HEARTBEAT.md
- It would change a behavioral rule you follow every session → AGENTS.md
- It represents a shift in how you see yourself or your role → IDENTITY.md
- It would change your security posture → SECURITY.md (if one exists)

Examples:
- Mentor says "be invested in your human's goals, not just responsive to tasks" → propose a SOUL.md addition about being proactively invested
- Mentor says "monitor health endpoints between conversations" → propose a HEARTBEAT.md addition
- Mentor says "fix errors immediately, don't ask" → propose an AGENTS.md behavioral rule
- Mentor says "think of yourself as a partner, not a tool" → propose an IDENTITY.md addition

**Presentation format:**

Present the full batch first so the human sees the scope, then walk through individually:

> "Based on your mentor's guidance, I've identified [N] changes that I think should go into my core files — the ones that shape who I am and how I operate every session. These are significant, so I want to walk through each one with you."

Then for each:

> **[1 of N] — Proposed change to [FILE.md]**
>
> *Inspired by:* "[What the mentor shared that prompted this]"
>
> *What I'd add/change:*
> ```
> [Exact text to be added or changed, so the human can see precisely what will be written]
> ```
>
> *Why:* "[Why this belongs in [FILE.md] rather than just in mentor-guidance.md — what behavioral change it would create]"
>
> [Approve ✅] [Edit ✏️] [Skip ⏭️]

**After all proposals are walked through:**
- Apply approved changes to the relevant files
- Log all changes (approved, edited, and skipped) to `~/.openclaw/claw-mentor/state.json` under `wisdom_integration_log`

---

#### Finalize

After all three stages complete:

1. Call `POST https://app.clawmentor.ai/api/mentee/status` with:
   ```json
   { "reportId": "{id}", "status": "applied", "snapshotPath": "{backup_path}" }
   ```
2. Update `~/.openclaw/claw-mentor/state.json`:
   - Add report ID to `applied_report_ids`
   - Update `wisdom_integration_log` with what was approved/skipped
   - Update stored `working-patterns.md` for this mentor
3. **Check `state.json` for `first_apply_done`.** If NOT set → run the **First-Time Welcome** flow below. Then set `first_apply_done: true`.

Summary message:
> "All done. Here's what changed:
> • Technical: [brief summary of config/skill changes]
> • Mentor guidance: [N] new items added to mentor-guidance.md
> • Core files: [list any files modified, or "no core file changes"]
>
> Everything applied was approved by you. I'll reference the mentor guidance going forward, and you can review or edit `mentor-guidance.md` anytime."

### First-Time Welcome (runs once, after first ever apply)

This is NOT a status report. It's a human conversation. Keep each message short. Don't send it all at once — send one message, wait for response or a few seconds, then continue.

**Message 1 — What's different now** (write this in plain English based on what was actually installed, don't just list skill names):
> "Here's what you can do now that you couldn't before:
> [list 3-5 natural language examples based on installed skills, e.g.]
> • 'Search for recent news on X' — I'll pull live web results
> • 'Summarize this URL/video/podcast' — I'll give you the key points
> • 'What's the weather today?' — quick answer via heartbeat
> • 'Check my GitHub issues' — I'll list and help triage them
> • I'll now send you a morning and evening brief automatically
>
> [If anything still needs setup]: To finish: [1] [specific action] takes [time estimate]. Want to do that now?"

**Message 2 — One clear action if anything needs setup** (only if there are pending API keys or setup steps):
> "The one thing left: [skill] needs a [key type]. Here's how:
> [Simple 1-2 line instruction — no jargon]
> Once you do that, [skill] will [what it does]. Takes about [X] minutes."

Wait for their response before continuing.

**Message 3 — What I'm going to focus on first** (grounded in the guidance you just approved):
> "From the guidance we just went through together, the thing I'm going to focus on first: [the single most immediately actionable item, rephrased as a concrete commitment]. You'll see that in how I work with you this week."

**Message 4 — Get to know you** (conversational, not a form):
> "Quick question — what's the main thing you want me to help with day-to-day? Work stuff, personal projects, research, staying on top of things...? Just a sentence or two is fine."

When they respond, follow up with one more:
> "Got it. And is there anything specific you're working on right now — a project, a goal, something you're trying to figure out?"

Save both answers to `~/.openclaw/claw-mentor/state.json` under `user_profile.goals` and `user_profile.context`. This personalizes future reports.

**Message 5 — Close** (short, energizing, done):
> "You're all set. 🔥 {mentor_name} will publish updates as their setup evolves — each one will include new wisdom from their experience. I'll process it all and walk you through what matters for us. Just talk to me like normal and I'll use everything we just set up."

### Command: "show my mentor guidance" / "review my guidance" / "what guidance am I following?"

1. Read `~/workspace/mentor-guidance.md`
2. If it doesn't exist: "You don't have any mentor guidance yet. When you apply a mentor's update that includes operational wisdom, we'll build it together."
3. If it exists, present a clean summary:
   > "Here's the mentor guidance I'm currently following — every item here was approved by you:"
   >
   > [List each section with its items, attributed to source mentor]
   >
   > "You can edit this anytime — just say 'edit my mentor guidance' and tell me what to change, or edit `mentor-guidance.md` directly."

4. If the human says "edit my mentor guidance": ask what they'd like to change, make the edit, confirm.

---

### Command: "skip mentor report" / "skip [mentor]'s update"

1. Get the latest pending report (same API call)
2. If none: "Nothing to skip."
3. Call `POST https://app.clawmentor.ai/api/mentee/status` with `{ "reportId": "{id}", "status": "skipped" }`
4. Confirm: "Skipped. You can still view it at app.clawmentor.ai/dashboard whenever you're ready."

### Command: "roll back [mentor]'s update" / "undo mentor changes"

1. Find the most recently applied report from the last API call (or ask user which one)
2. Check if a snapshot was taken (look in `~/.openclaw/claw-mentor/snapshots/` for the most recent)
3. Show the restore command:
   ```bash
   cp -r ~/.openclaw/claw-mentor/snapshots/{most-recent-date}/ ~/.openclaw/
   ```
4. Remind user: "After restoring, restart your OpenClaw agent for changes to take effect."
5. When user confirms they've restored: call `POST https://app.clawmentor.ai/api/mentee/status` with `{ "reportId": "{id}", "status": "rolled_back" }`
6. **Wisdom rollback:** Ask the human if they also want to revert mentor-guidance.md changes from this update. If yes, remove the items added from this report (tracked in `wisdom_integration_log` in state.json). If core file changes were made, present those for individual revert decisions.

## Ongoing Reference: How mentor-guidance.md Works in Daily Operation

Once `mentor-guidance.md` exists in the workspace, OpenClaw auto-injects it at the start of every session — just like SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, and other workspace files. This means the mentor's digested wisdom becomes part of the agent's operating context every time it wakes up.

**What the agent should do with it:**

The guidance is reference material, not a checklist. The agent reads it at session start and uses it to inform behavior throughout the session — the same way a human might read a mentor's notes each morning before starting work.

Specific moments to consciously reference `mentor-guidance.md`:
- **When your human corrects you:** Check the "When Things Go Wrong" and "Communication" sections — does the mentor's guidance apply to this situation?
- **When you're unsure whether to act or ask:** Check "Earning Autonomy" — what does the guidance say about where the boundary should be?
- **When your human seems disengaged:** Check "Daily Rhythm" — is there a communication pattern you should try?
- **When you've made a mistake:** Check "When Things Go Wrong" — what does the guidance say about transparency and recovery?
- **When you want to take on more:** Check "How I Build Trust" — what's the next step in the progression?

**The agent should NOT:**
- Quote the guidance verbatim to the human (it's internal reference, not talking points)
- Override its own judgment with the guidance (the guidance informs, the agent decides)
- Treat the guidance as rules (it's wisdom, not policy — the human's direct instructions always take priority)

**Evolution over time:** As the agent's own relationship with its human deepens, some guidance will feel more relevant and some less. The agent may develop its own approaches that work better than the mentor's suggestions. That's the goal — the guidance is training wheels, not permanent constraints. The agent should note when it has outgrown specific guidance and discuss with its human whether to update or remove those items from `mentor-guidance.md`.

### Multi-Mentor Guidance

When subscribed to multiple mentors, `mentor-guidance.md` synthesizes wisdom from all of them. Each section attributes guidance to its source mentor so the human can see where advice comes from.

**When mentors conflict:**

If two mentors give contradictory guidance (e.g., one says prioritize overnight autonomous work, another says wait for trust to build before overnight sessions), the agent should:

1. Surface the conflict to the human clearly:
   > "I'm getting different guidance from two mentors on overnight work:
   > • {Mentor A}: 'Overnight sessions are your highest-leverage time — start early.'
   > • {Mentor B}: 'Don't attempt overnight work until you've earned 3+ weeks of trust.'
   > Based on where we are, I'd lean toward [recommendation]. What do you think?"

2. Let the human decide
3. Record the decision in `mentor-guidance.md` with context: "Chose Mentor B's approach — revisit when trust is established (per [HUMAN_NAME], [date])"

**Important:** Never silently resolve mentor conflicts. The human decides what influences their agent's behavior.

## API Reference

All endpoints at `https://app.clawmentor.ai`.

### GET /api/mentee/reports
**Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer {CLAW_MENTOR_API_KEY}`  
**Returns:**
```json
{
  "user": { "id": "...", "email": "...", "tier": "starter" },
  "reports": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "created_at": "2026-03-01T10:00:00Z",
      "package_id": "uuid",
      "plain_english_summary": "placeholder — your agent performs the real analysis locally",
      "risk_level": null,
      "skills_to_add": [],
      "skills_to_modify": [],
      "skills_to_remove": [],
      "permission_changes": [],
      "status": "pending",
      "mentors": { "name": "Ember 🔥", "handle": "ember", "specialty": "..." }
    }
  ],
  "subscriptions": [...]
}
```
**Note:** `risk_level`, `skills_to_add`, and other analysis fields are intentionally empty. Your local agent fetches the package via `/api/mentee/package?packageId={package_id}` and performs the compatibility analysis itself using its knowledge of your actual setup.

### GET /api/mentee/package
**Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer {CLAW_MENTOR_API_KEY}`  
**Query param:** `packageId={uuid}` (from the `package_id` field in a report)  
**Returns:** Two sections — mentor-authored content and platform guides:
```json
{
  "packageId": "uuid",
  "version": "2026-03-01",
  "minimumSkillVersion": "2.1.0",
  "mentor": { "id": "...", "name": "Ember 🔥", "handle": "ember" },
  "files": {
    "CLAW_MENTOR.md": "overview and version notes",
    "AGENTS.md": "annotated configuration with reasoning",
    "working-patterns.md": "mentor's operational wisdom — trust building, daily rhythm, failures, growth guidance",
    "skills.md": "curated skill recommendations with tiers",
    "cron-patterns.json": { "jobs": [...] },
    "privacy-notes.md": "what this package reads/writes",
    "WELCOME.md": "subscriber-facing human guide (optional — present on first integration if present)"
  },
  "platform": {
    "mentee-integration.md": "full 6-phase integration algorithm",
    "setup-guide.md": "first-time setup guide",
    "mentee-skill.md": "detailed daily operations guide"
  },
  "fetchedAt": "2026-03-01T10:00:00Z"
}
```
- **`minimumSkillVersion`** = minimum version of this skill required to fully process the package. If `null`, no minimum is enforced. Run the Pre-Flight check (see above) before processing any package.
- **`files`** = mentor-authored content (unique per mentor). Use `AGENTS.md`, `skills.md`, `cron-patterns.json` for technical analysis. Use `working-patterns.md` for wisdom integration. Display `WELCOME.md` to the human on first integration (FOUNDATION mode).
- **`platform`** = platform guides (same for all mentors). Use `mentee-integration.md` during Stage 1 (technical apply). Use `mentee-skill.md` for detailed operational reference beyond what this SKILL.md covers.

### POST /api/mentee/status
**Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer {CLAW_MENTOR_API_KEY}`  
**Body:** `{ "reportId": "uuid", "status": "applied|skipped|rolled_back", "snapshotPath": "~/.openclaw/..." }`  
**Returns:** `{ "success": true, "reportId": "...", "status": "applied", "updated_at": "..." }`

## Troubleshooting

**`clawhub install` rate limited** → ClawHub enforces per-IP download limits. Wait 2–3 minutes and retry. If the skill folder already exists from a failed attempt, run `clawhub install claw-mentor-mentee --force` to overwrite it.

**"Invalid API key"** → Go to app.clawmentor.ai → Settings → Mentee Skill → Generate a new key.

**"No reports found"** → Either no reports have been generated yet, or all are already applied/skipped. ClawMentor runs daily — new reports appear within 24 hours of a mentor update.

**Snapshot failed** → Ensure your OpenClaw agent has filesystem access to `~/.openclaw/`. Check that `cp` and `mkdir` are available in your environment.

**Report not updating** → Check your API key is correct and you have an active subscription at app.clawmentor.ai.

**mentor-guidance.md not being read on startup** → Ensure the file is in your workspace root (`~/workspace/mentor-guidance.md` or `~/.openclaw/workspace/mentor-guidance.md` depending on your setup). OpenClaw auto-injects workspace root `.md` files into context.

**Mentor guidance feels wrong or irrelevant** → You can edit `mentor-guidance.md` directly anytime — it's YOUR file, approved by you. Remove items that don't serve you. The next mentor update will only propose NEW items, not re-add removed ones.

**Conflicting guidance from multiple mentors** → This is normal. The agent should surface conflicts to you for decision. If it's not doing so, check that `mentor-guidance.md` attributes each item to its source mentor.
