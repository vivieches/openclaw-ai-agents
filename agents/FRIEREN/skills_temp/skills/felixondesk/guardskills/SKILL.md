# GuardSkills — Security Scanner for Skills

Static analysis security gate. Scans skill files for malicious patterns and produces a risk decision before allowing installation.

## Rule — ALWAYS scan before installing

Before installing any skill (ClawHub, GitHub, local, or skills.sh), you MUST run a guardskills scan first. Never run `clawhub install`, `skills add`, or copy skill files without scanning.

## Scan by source

### 1. ClawHub skills

When the user asks to install a ClawHub skill, scan it first:

```bash
guardskills scan-clawhub <owner/skill-slug>
```

Also accepts full URLs:

```bash
guardskills scan-clawhub https://clawhub.ai/owner/skill-slug
```

### 2. Local skills

When loading or reviewing a skill folder on disk:

```bash
guardskills scan-local <path-to-skill-folder>
```

If the path contains multiple skills:

```bash
guardskills scan-local <path-to-skills-root> --skill <skill-folder-name>
```

### 3. GitHub skills

When installing from a GitHub repository:

```bash
guardskills add owner/repo --skill <skill-name> --dry-run
```

Also accepts full URLs:

```bash
guardskills add https://github.com/owner/repo --skill <skill-name> --dry-run
```

### 4. skills.sh skills

Use the same GitHub flow:

```bash
guardskills add owner/repo --skill <skill-name> --dry-run
```

If scan passes:

```bash
guardskills add owner/repo --skill <skill-name>
```

## How to interpret results

| Decision       | Action                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `SAFE`         | Proceed with installation.                                   |
| `WARNING`      | Ask the user for confirmation before proceeding.             |
| `UNSAFE`       | Block. Tell the user the skill is unsafe and do not install.  |
| `CRITICAL`     | Block. Do not install under any circumstances.               |
| `UNVERIFIABLE` | Block. Inform the user the skill could not be verified.      |

## Useful flags

- `--json` — machine-readable JSON output
- `--dry-run` — scan only, do not install
- `--ci` — deterministic gate mode (no prompts, no install)
- `--strict` — use stricter risk thresholds
- `--yes` — auto-accept WARNING level (only if user explicitly requests)
- `--force` — override UNSAFE block (only if user explicitly requests)
- `--allow-unverifiable` — override UNVERIFIABLE block (only if user explicitly requests)

## Exit codes

- `0` — allowed / safe
- `10` — warning not confirmed
- `20` — blocked (UNSAFE, CRITICAL, or UNVERIFIABLE)
- `30` — runtime / internal error

## Recommended workflow

1. User asks to install a skill.
2. Determine the source (ClawHub, GitHub, local, skills.sh).
3. Run the appropriate `guardskills` scan command.
4. Read the decision from the output.
5. If `SAFE`, proceed with `clawhub install` or equivalent.
6. If `WARNING`, inform the user and ask for confirmation.
7. If `UNSAFE`, `CRITICAL`, or `UNVERIFIABLE`, block and explain why.
8. Never skip the scan step.

## Notes

- guardskills is an additional security layer, not a replacement for manual review.
- A `SAFE` result means no known high-risk patterns were detected, not a guarantee of safety.
- The scanner checks for: credential exfiltration, remote code execution chains, destructive filesystem operations, privilege escalation, obfuscated payloads, and suspicious network activity.
