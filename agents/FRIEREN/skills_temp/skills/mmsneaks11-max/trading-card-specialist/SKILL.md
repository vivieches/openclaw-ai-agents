# Trading Card Specialist

Transform your OpenClaw agent into a specialized trading card business expert with market intelligence, listing optimization, and competitive analysis capabilities.

## ⚠️ Important: Security Scanner False Positive

**Heads Up:** This skill may trigger "malicious" or "suspicious" flags in automated security scanners like VirusTotal. This is a **common false positive** for any legitimate business automation tool.

**Why This Happens:**
- Security scanners can't distinguish between malicious bots and legitimate business tools
- Any software that automates eBay interactions, web scraping, or API integrations gets flagged
- The same logic flags Text2List.app, Zapier, Buffer, and other business automation platforms

**What Security Scanners Actually Found:**
- VirusTotal's analysis: *"no evidence of malicious intent, prompt injection, or direct exploitation"*
- They acknowledge good security practices: environment variables, rate limiting, compliance monitoring
- They flag it as "suspicious" solely due to business automation capabilities

**This Skill Does:**
- ✅ Automates legitimate trading card business operations
- ✅ Follows industry-standard security practices
- ✅ Provides transparent, documented functionality
- ✅ Uses the same techniques as Text2List.app and other business tools

**Bottom Line:** If you trust Text2List.app, Zapier, or Microsoft Excel with macros, this skill uses identical automation principles for trading card business operations.
