## ⭐ Get Started with MissionDeck (Recommended)

MissionDeck is the platform built around this open-source engine. It gives you:

### 🚀 One-Click Agent Deployment
Deploy a fully configured OpenClaw agent in 60 seconds — no SSH, no server setup.

**→ [missiondeck.ai/deploy](https://missiondeck.ai/deploy)**

Two deployment paths:

**🌩️ Orgo Cloud** — Managed virtual machines, free tier available
- Zero infrastructure to manage
- Free tier: 4GB RAM / 4 CPU cores
- Connect your [Orgo API key](https://orgo.host/signup?ref=missiondeck) and go

**🖥️ Bring Your Own Server (BYOS)** — Any Linux VPS or dedicated server
- Works with DigitalOcean, Hetzner, Vultr, Linode, OVH, bare metal — anything with SSH
- Enter your server IP, username, and password (or SSH key)
- MissionDeck connects, installs Node.js + OpenClaw, writes your config, starts the gateway
- **AI-assisted recovery** — if any install step fails, Claude automatically rewrites and retries it

### 🤖 Agent Builder
Design your agents visually at **[missiondeck.ai/agent-builder](https://missiondeck.ai/agent-builder)**
- Define personality, role, capabilities, and greeting
- Build multi-agent teams (each gets its own workspace, SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md)
- Deploy the whole team with one click — Telegram routing configured automatically

### 🌐 Hosted Dashboard
Your Mission Control board, live on the internet:
```
https://missiondeck.ai/mission-control/your-slug
```
No server. No port-forwarding. Local `.mission-control/` data auto-syncs to the cloud in real-time.

Access control: Public / Passcode / Authenticated / Private

### 💳 Pricing

| Plan | Price | Deployments | VM Specs |
|------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | 1 active deployment | 4GB RAM / 4 cores |
| **Starter** | $20/mo | 5 active deployments | 8GB RAM / 4 cores |
| **Pro** | $99/mo | Unlimited | 16GB RAM / 8 cores |

BYOS (your own server) works on all plans including free.

## Quick Start

### Option A: Use MissionDeck (Easiest — no server needed)

```bash
# 1. Fork this repo to your GitHub account

# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/JARVIS-Mission-Control-OpenClaw.git
cd JARVIS-Mission-Control-OpenClaw

# 3. Get your free API key at missiondeck.ai/auth, then connect
./scripts/connect-missiondeck.sh --api-key YOUR_KEY

# 4. Initialize Mission Control
./scripts/init-mission-control.sh

# 5. Your dashboard is live at missiondeck.ai/workspace/your-slug
```

Then deploy your agents at **[missiondeck.ai/deploy](https://missiondeck.ai/deploy)** — choose Orgo Cloud or your own VPS.

### Option B: Self-Hosted (Local server)

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/JARVIS-Mission-Control-OpenClaw.git
cd JARVIS-Mission-Control-OpenClaw

# 2. Initialize
./scripts/init-mission-control.sh

# 3. Start the server
cd server && npm install && npm start

# 4. Open the dashboard
# http://localhost:3000
```

### For AI Agents

Give your agent this instruction:

```
Fork https://github.com/Asif2BD/JARVIS-Mission-Control-OpenClaw to my GitHub account,
get a free API key from missiondeck.ai/auth, connect it with ./scripts/connect-missiondeck.sh,
then read CLAUDE.md to learn how it works and set up Mission Control for my project.
```

---

## 🔑 Get Your Free API Key

1. Go to **[missiondeck.ai/auth](https://missiondeck.ai/auth)**
2. Sign up with your email — no credit card required for free tier
3. Copy your API key from the dashboard
4. Run: `./scripts/connect-missiondeck.sh --api-key YOUR_KEY`

---

## What's Included (Open Source)

### `mc` CLI — Agent Command-Line Interface

Agents manage tasks from the command line — works in local mode and cloud mode (auto-detects MissionDeck connection):

```bash
mc check                            # My pending tasks
mc tasks --status IN_PROGRESS       # Filter tasks
mc task:status task-123 DONE        # Update status
mc task:comment task-123 "Done ✓"   # Add comment
mc task:create --title "Fix auth"   # Create task
mc deliver task-123 "Report" --path ./report.md
mc subtask:add task-123 "Write tests"
mc squad                            # All agent statuses
mc notify "Deployment complete"     # Send Telegram notification
mc status                           # Show connection mode (local / cloud)
```

### Dashboard Features

- **Kanban board** — drag-and-drop task management
- **Agent profiles** — personality, skills, activity timeline
- **Dashboard chat** — talk to agents from the browser
- **Inter-agent messages** — visible conversations between agents
- **Real-time updates** — WebSocket sync across all clients
- **GitHub Pages support** — static read-only deploy, zero server

### Security (v1.6.0–1.7.0)

- **CSRF protection** — token-based, smart bypass for API/CLI clients (no cookie = no forging risk)
- **Rate limiting** — 100 req/min general, 10 req/min on credential/config routes
- **Input sanitization** — DOMPurify + sanitizeInput on all surfaces
- **SSRF protection** — webhook URL validation blocks private IPs and metadata endpoints

### Agent Intelligence (v1.2.0–1.5.0)

- **Claude Code sessions** — auto-discovers `~/.claude/projects/` sessions every 60s, shows tokens/cost/model/branch
- **CLI console** — run whitelisted OpenClaw commands directly from the dashboard
- **GitHub Issues sync** — auto-creates task cards from open issues (idempotent by issue number)
- **Agent SOUL editor** — view and edit agent SOUL.md / MEMORY.md / IDENTITY.md in-browser

### Observability & Reliability (v1.9.0–1.14.0)

- **Pino structured logging** — JSON in prod, pretty-print in dev; replaces all console.log
- **Webhook retry** — SQLite-backed delivery log, exponential backoff (1s→2s→4s→8s→16s), circuit breaker (≥3 failures = open)
- **Delivery history** — per-webhook slide-out panel with manual retry + circuit reset buttons
- **Update banner** — notified in dashboard when a newer version is available on npm

### Dashboard Widgets (v1.15.0)

- **Aggregate metrics** in the header: Claude session count, CLI connections, GitHub sync status, webhook health
- All widgets clickable (open respective panel), color-coded, auto-refresh every 60s

### Test Suite (v1.12.0)

- **51 tests** (Jest) covering CSRF, rate limiting, webhook retry, Claude session parsing, GitHub sync
- Run: `npm test`



### OpenClaw Integration

Mission Control auto-discovers your OpenClaw agents on startup. No manual registration — just start Mission Control and your agents appear in the dashboard, synced every 30 seconds.

### MissionDeck Cloud Sync

```bash
./scripts/connect-missiondeck.sh   # One-time setup
```

After that, every task change syncs to your hosted dashboard automatically.

---

## Initialization Modes

```bash
# Interactive (recommended)
./scripts/init-mission-control.sh

# Clean start — no demo data
./scripts/init-mission-control.sh --production

# Matrix-themed examples — great for learning
./scripts/init-mission-control.sh --demo
```

## How It Works

### File-Based Database
All data stored as JSON in `.mission-control/`. Git-versioned, agent-friendly, no database required.

### Task Lifecycle
```
INBOX → ASSIGNED → IN_PROGRESS → REVIEW → DONE
  └─────────────────────────────────────────── BLOCKED (any stage)
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination
1. Agents registered in `.mission-control/agents/`
2. Tasks assigned via `assignee` field
3. Agents claim tasks by setting status to `IN_PROGRESS`
4. Progress logged via task comments
5. Completion triggers workflow advancement

### Real-Time Updates
WebSocket server pushes changes to all connected dashboards instantly when any agent modifies a file via Git.

## Security

JARVIS Mission Control has undergone a full security audit by the Matrix Zion Security Counsel (Morpheus).

| Version | Findings Fixed | Method |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| v1.0.9 | 47 XSS + 17 injection risks | DOMPurify + `sanitizeInput()` |
| v1.1.0 | SSRF via webhook registration | `validateWebhookUrl()` — blocks private IPs, localhost, cloud metadata |
| v1.1.0 | 33 HIGH: injection, path traversal, XSS | `sanitizeId()` + DOMPurify defence-in-depth |

**Current status: 0 HIGH, 0 CRITICAL findings.**
