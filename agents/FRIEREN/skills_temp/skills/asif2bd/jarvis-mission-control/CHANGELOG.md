Format: [version] — date | what changed | PR

## [2.0.3] — 2026-03-04 | Smart Panels — Chat, Reports, Schedules

**PR #73 + PR #74**

### Added
- 💬 **Mission Control Chat** — slide-out panel, real-time WebSocket, agent emojis, unread badge, @mention support
- 📋 **Reports panel** — slide-out from header button, Reports/Logs/Archive tabs, fixed double `/api/` URL bug
- ⏰ **Schedules panel** — slide-out from header button, shows all 14 live OpenClaw cron jobs (fixed wrong endpoint)
- Right sidebar removed — Kanban gets full width; all panels via header buttons

### Fixed
- Smart panels not opening (mobile + desktop) — JS never added `.open` CSS class; fixed with `offsetHeight` reflow + `classList.add('open')`

---

## [2.0.2] — 2026-03-04 | Right Panel Fixes

**PR #71**

### Fixed
- Reports "Failed to load files" — double `/api/api/` prefix bug in `api.js`
- Resources hidden from sidebar (accessible via Settings modal)
- Chat overflow off-screen resolved

---

## [2.0.1] — 2026-03-04 | Dark Mode + Getting Started Fix

**PR #70**

### Fixed
- Dashboard defaulting to white/light mode — hardcoded `data-theme="dark"` on `<html>`
- "Getting Started" modal no longer blocks Kanban when server is connected

---

## [2.0.0] — 2026-03-04 | Major UI Overhaul

**PRs #65–#69**

### Added
- **Widget Cards** (v1.16.0) — 4 large clickable stat cards: Claude Sessions, CLI Connections, GitHub Sync, Webhook Health
- **Enhanced Task Cards** (v1.17.0) — priority color bars, agent avatar circles, label badges, review indicator
- **Sidebar Groups** (v1.18.0) — TEAM / INTELLIGENCE / SYSTEM collapsible sections with localStorage persistence
- **Panel Redesign** (v1.19.0) — gradient headers, icon boxes, Orbitron titles, stat badges on all 6 panels
- **Matrix Theme Polish** (v2.0.0) — CRT scanlines, pulse-glow on agents, Matrix rain header accent, typewriter version cursor

---


## [2.0.3] — 2026-03-04 | Smart Slide-out Panels

**PR #73** — `feature/smart-panels-v2.0.3`
**PR #74** — `fix/smart-panels-open-class`

### Added
- `dashboard/js/smart-panels.js` — new module powering three on-demand panels
- **💬 Chat panel** — full-height slide-out from CHAT header button
  - Real-time via WebSocket (`message.created` events)
  - Message bubbles with per-agent emoji avatars (🔧 Tank, 🔮 Oracle, 🧠 Morpheus…)
  - Unread badge on header button when panel is closed
  - Send via `POST /api/messages`, receive via WS broadcast
- **📋 Reports & Files panel** — slide-out from REPORTS header button
  - Tabs: Reports / Logs / Archive
  - File list with ext badge, size, date, download link
  - Clean empty state
- **⏰ Schedules panel** — slide-out from SCHEDULES header button
  - Calls `/api/schedules` (was previously calling wrong endpoint `/api/queue`)
  - Shows all OpenClaw cron jobs across all agents with agent emoji, schedule type, last run
  - Filter: All / Active / Disabled
- Three header action buttons replace the removed right sidebar: CHAT · REPORTS · SCHEDULES

### Fixed
- Smart panels not opening on click (PR #74): panels use `transform: translateX(100%)` by default; `.open` CSS class slides them in — `_openPanel()` was setting `display: flex` but never adding `.open`
- `/api/schedules` now correctly returns OpenClaw cron jobs (14 real jobs); old code called `/api/queue` which only reads local queue (always empty)
- Floating chat widget replaced by slide-out (no more viewport overflow)

### Changed
- Right sidebar (`sidebar-right`) permanently hidden (`display: none !important`) — Kanban board gets full available width
- Old floating chat HTML replaced with stub divs to prevent JS errors from old references

---

## [2.0.2] — 2026-03-04 | Right Panel Bug Fixes

**PR #70** — `fix/dark-mode-default-and-modal`
**PR #71** — `fix/right-panel-and-chat`

### Fixed
- **Dark mode not defaulting**: `initTheme()` was following `prefers-color-scheme: light` system setting; now always defaults to `'dark'` regardless of OS preference
- **Getting Started modal blocking board**: modal now only shows after 2s delay AND only when `!api.isConnected()` — server is always running so modal never fires
- **"Failed to load files" error**: `getFiles()` in `api.js` was passing `/api/files?dir=reports` to `request()` which prepends `/api`, producing URL `/api/api/files` → 404 → catch block → "Failed to load files". Fixed to `/files?dir=...`
- **Resources section removed from sidebar**: was displaying 0/0/0 with no inline actions — hidden from permanent view (Resources modal still accessible via Settings)

---

## [2.0.0] — 2026-03-04 | Matrix Theme Polish
