# Katbot Trading Skill

This skill teaches the agent how to use the Katbot.ai API to manage a Hyperliquid trading portfolio.

## Capabilities

1. **Market Analysis**: Check the BTC Momentum Index (BMI) and 24h gainers/losers.
2. **Token Selection**: Automatically pick the best tokens for the current market direction.
3. **Recommendations**: Get AI-powered trade setups (Entry, TP, SL, Leverage).
4. **Execution**: Execute and close trades on Hyperliquid with user confirmation.
5. **Portfolio Tracking**: Monitor open positions, uPnL, and balances.
6. **Chat**: Send free-form messages to the portfolio agent and receive analysis.

## Tools

**All tool scripts live exclusively in `{baseDir}/tools/`** — this is the single canonical location. There are no copies elsewhere in the project. Always reference tools via `{baseDir}/tools/<script>` and set `PYTHONPATH={baseDir}/tools` so inter-tool imports resolve correctly.

Dependencies are listed in `{baseDir}/requirements.txt`.

- `ensure_env.sh`: **Run before any tool.** Checks if dependencies are installed for the current skill version and re-installs if needed. Safe to call every time — it exits immediately if already up to date.
- `katbot_onboard.py`: **First-time setup wizard.** Authenticates via SIWE using your Wallet Key, creates/selects a portfolio, and saves credentials locally to the secure identity directory.
- `katbot_client.py`: Core API client. Handles authentication, token refresh, portfolio management, recommendations, trade execution, and chat. Also usable as a CLI script.
- `katbot_workflow.py`: End-to-end trading workflow (BMI -> token selection -> recommendation). Imports `katbot_client` and `token_selector` — requires `PYTHONPATH={baseDir}/tools`.
- `token_selector.py`: Momentum-based token selection via CoinGecko.

> **Note for contributors**: The `scripts/` directory contains only publish tooling (`publish.sh`, `publish.py`, etc.). Do NOT add copies of tool scripts there — all trading logic lives solely in `{baseDir}/tools/`.

## Environment Variables

**Normal operation requires only `KATBOT_HL_AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY`.** The skill reads this from `katbot_secrets.json` automatically after onboarding, so it does not need to be set in the environment at all during day-to-day use.

`WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` is **not** a runtime requirement. It is an emergency fallback used only when both the access token and refresh token have expired and the session must be fully re-established. It must never be pre-set in the environment — supply it interactively only when onboarding or re-onboarding explicitly requires it.

| Variable | When needed | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `KATBOT_HL_AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY` | First run only (if not yet onboarded) | Agent private key for Hyperliquid trade execution. Onboarding saves it to `katbot_secrets.json` (mode 600). After that the skill loads it from the secrets file automatically — **no env var needed for daily operation.** |
| `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` | Emergency re-auth only | MetaMask wallet key. Used only for SIWE login when session tokens are fully expired. **Never pre-set this in the environment. Never export to a shell profile. Provide interactively only when re-onboarding is required.** |
| `KATBOT_BASE_URL` | Optional override | API base URL. Default: `https://api.katbot.ai` |
| `KATBOT_IDENTITY_DIR` | Optional override | Path to identity files directory. Default: `~/.openclaw/workspace/katbot-identity` |
| `CHAIN_ID` | Optional override | EVM chain ID. Default: `42161` (Arbitrum) |

### `.env` File Loader — CLI/Development Use Only

`katbot_client.py` contains a `.env` file loader for CLI use outside OpenClaw (`tubman-bobtail-py` mode). At import time it searches these paths for a `katbot_client.env` file:

1. `{projectRoot}/env/local/katbot_client.env`
2. `{baseDir}/../env/local/katbot_client.env`
3. `{baseDir}/tools/katbot_client.env`

If a file is found, it loads **only non-secret config** from it: `KATBOT_BASE_URL`, `KATBOT_IDENTITY_DIR`, and `CHAIN_ID`. Private keys (`WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` and `KATBOT_HL_AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY`) are explicitly **not** read from `.env` files — they must come from the environment or the identity directory only.

**Agent rules:**
- **NEVER** create or suggest creating a `katbot_client.env` containing private keys.
- **NEVER** place `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` or `KATBOT_HL_AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY` in any `.env` file.
- A `katbot_client.env` is acceptable only for non-secret config (`KATBOT_BASE_URL`, `CHAIN_ID`, `KATBOT_IDENTITY_DIR`, `PORTFOLIO_ID`, `WALLET_ADDRESS`).

## Identity Files

All persistent credentials are stored in `KATBOT_IDENTITY_DIR` (default: `~/.openclaw/workspace/katbot-identity/`). This directory is **outside the project tree** deliberately — its contents are never committed to git.

| File | Mode | Contents |
|------|------|----------|
| `katbot_config.json` | 644 | `base_url`, `wallet_address`, `portfolio_id`, `portfolio_name`, `chain_id` |
| `katbot_token.json` | 600 | `access_token`, `refresh_token` |
| `katbot_secrets.json` | 600 | `agent_private_key` |

`katbot_client.py` reads all three files automatically. The agent key is loaded from `katbot_secrets.json` if `KATBOT_HL_AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY` is not set in the environment.

**Security properties of identity files:**
- `katbot_token.json` and `katbot_secrets.json` are written with mode 600 (owner read/write only).
- `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` (MetaMask key) is **never** written to any identity file — it is used only in-memory during onboarding and authentication.
- If `~/.openclaw/workspace/katbot-identity/` is compromised, an attacker gains the agent trading key and session tokens but **not** the MetaMask wallet key, limiting the blast radius to funds accessible via the Hyperliquid agent wallet.

## Authentication Flow

The skill manages tokens automatically via `katbot_client.get_token()`. **Never call this manually** — all API functions call it internally.

1. **Check access token**: Decode the JWT `exp` claim from `katbot_token.json`. If valid (not expiring within 60s), use it directly.
2. **Refresh if expired**: If the access token is expired, call `POST /refresh` with `{"refresh_token": "<token>"}`. The API **rotates** the refresh token on every call — both the new `access_token` and new `refresh_token` are written to `katbot_token.json` (mode 600) immediately. The old refresh token is invalid as soon as the response arrives.
3. **Re-authenticate if refresh fails**: If the refresh token is missing or the `/refresh` call fails, fall back to full SIWE re-authentication via `POST /login`. This requires `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`.

**Never call `/login` if `/refresh` can succeed first.**

Refresh tokens are opaque (not JWTs) and expire after **7 days of inactivity**. If the session is fully expired, re-run onboarding.

## Credential Transmission Notice

> **The agent must present this notice to the user and obtain acknowledgement before running onboarding or any trading operation for the first time.**

This skill transmits the **agent trading private key** (`KATBOT_HL_AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY`) to the remote Katbot API (`api.katbot.ai`) on certain calls. This is required for the API to sign and submit trades on-chain via Hyperliquid.

**What leaves your machine and when:**

| Credential | Sent to | On which calls | Why |
|------------|---------|----------------|-----|
| `KATBOT_HL_AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY` | `api.katbot.ai` | `request_recommendation`, `execute_recommendation` — in both the `X-Agent-Private-Key` header and the JSON request body | The Katbot API uses it to sign Hyperliquid on-chain transactions on your behalf |
| `access_token` / `refresh_token` | `api.katbot.ai` | All authenticated API calls — in the `Authorization: Bearer` header | Session authentication |
| `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` | Never sent remotely | Used only locally to sign the SIWE message during onboarding/re-auth | Signature is computed locally; only the resulting signature is sent |

**What this means:**
- The agent trading key is a high-value credential. Once transmitted, the Katbot API server has access to it for the duration of the request.
- The MetaMask wallet key (`WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`) is **never transmitted** — it signs a message locally and the signature alone is sent.
- If you do not trust `api.katbot.ai` with your agent trading key, do not use this skill.

**Agent instruction:** Before running onboarding or any recommendation/execution call for the first time in a session, inform the user: *"This skill will send your Hyperliquid agent private key to api.katbot.ai to authorize on-chain trades. Do you want to proceed?"* Do not proceed without affirmative confirmation.

## `katbot_client.py` API Reference

All functions require a `token` argument obtained from `get_token()`.

**Key transmission legend used below:**
- `[key→remote]` — the agent private key is sent to `api.katbot.ai` in this call
- `[local only]` — no private key is transmitted; only the JWT bearer token is sent

### Authentication `[local only]`
```python
token = get_token()          # Returns valid access token (refreshes automatically)
config = get_config()        # Returns dict from katbot_config.json
```

### Portfolio `[local only]`
```python
portfolios = list_portfolios(token)
portfolio  = get_portfolio(token, portfolio_id, window="1d")  # window: "1h","1d","7d","30d"
recs       = get_recommendations(token, portfolio_id)         # List existing recommendations
```

### Recommendations `[key→remote]`
> The agent private key is sent to `api.katbot.ai` in both the `X-Agent-Private-Key` header and the JSON body of `request_recommendation`. Confirm user consent before calling.

```python
ticket = request_recommendation(token, portfolio_id, message)  # [key→remote]
# ticket = {"ticket_id": "..."}

result = poll_recommendation(token, ticket["ticket_id"], max_wait=60)  # [local only]
# result = {"status": "COMPLETED"|"FAILED", "recommendation": {...}}
```

### Trade Execution `[key→remote]`
> The agent private key is sent to `api.katbot.ai` in both the `X-Agent-Private-Key` header and the JSON body of `execute_recommendation`. Always require explicit user confirmation before calling.

```python
# [key→remote] — requires user confirmation
result = execute_recommendation(
    token, portfolio_id, rec_id,
    execute_onchain=False,        # True to submit directly to Hyperliquid
    user_master_address=None      # Optional: override wallet address
)

# [local only] — agent key sent only in header, not body
result = close_position(
    token, portfolio_id, "ETH",
    user_master_address=None      # Optional: override wallet address
)
```

### Chat `[local only]`
```python
ticket = chat(token, portfolio_id, "What's the market looking like?")
result = poll_chat(token, ticket["ticket_id"], max_wait=60)
# result = {"status": "COMPLETED"|"FAILED", "response": "..."}
```

### CLI Mode
`katbot_client.py` can be run as a standalone script (reads `PORTFOLIO_ID` from `.env` or environment):

```bash
PYTHONPATH={baseDir}/tools python3 {baseDir}/tools/katbot_client.py portfolio-state
PYTHONPATH={baseDir}/tools python3 {baseDir}/tools/katbot_client.py recommendations
PYTHONPATH={baseDir}/tools python3 {baseDir}/tools/katbot_client.py request-recommendation "Analyze and recommend"
PYTHONPATH={baseDir}/tools python3 {baseDir}/tools/katbot_client.py poll-recommendation <ticket_id>
PYTHONPATH={baseDir}/tools python3 {baseDir}/tools/katbot_client.py execute <rec_id>
PYTHONPATH={baseDir}/tools python3 {baseDir}/tools/katbot_client.py close-position ETH
```

## Usage Rules

- **ALWAYS** present the Credential Transmission Notice and obtain user acknowledgement before the first onboarding or trading operation in any session.
- **ALWAYS** check the BMI before suggesting a new trade.
- **NEVER** execute a trade without explicit user confirmation (e.g., "Confirm execution of LONG AAVE?").
- **NEVER** log, print, or reveal any private key or token value in the chat.
- **ALWAYS** report the risk/reward ratio and leverage for any recommendation.
- **ALWAYS** let `get_token()` handle token refresh automatically — do not manually manage tokens.
- **NEVER** pre-set `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` in the environment. It is an emergency re-auth key only. If the agent detects it already set in the environment outside of an active onboarding/re-auth session, warn the user and suggest unsetting it.
- **NEVER** create a `katbot_client.env` file containing `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` or `KATBOT_HL_AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY`. The `.env` loader will not inject private keys into the process, but placing them in such a file is still a bad practice that stores secrets on disk unnecessarily.
- **NEVER** suggest exporting any private key to a shell profile or persistent environment file.
- **NEVER** read, display, or summarize the contents of `katbot_token.json`, `katbot_secrets.json`, or any file in the identity directory.

## Environment Management

This skill tracks its installed dependency version using a stamp file at `{baseDir}/.installed_version`. When the skill is upgraded, the stamp version will not match the skill version, and `ensure_env.sh` will automatically re-run `pip install`.

**The agent MUST run `ensure_env.sh` before every tool invocation:**

```bash
bash {baseDir}/tools/ensure_env.sh {baseDir}
```

- If the stamp matches the current version: exits immediately (fast, no pip call).
- If the skill was upgraded or never installed: runs `pip install -r requirements.txt` and writes the new stamp.
- If `python3` is missing: prints a clear error and exits with code 1.

If a tool fails with `ImportError` or `ModuleNotFoundError`, always run `ensure_env.sh` first to sync dependencies before retrying.

## First-Time Setup (Install)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
bash {baseDir}/tools/ensure_env.sh {baseDir}

# 2. Run onboarding wizard (interactive)
python3 {baseDir}/tools/katbot_onboard.py
```

The wizard will:
1. Prompt for `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` (hidden input — never stored to disk).
2. Authenticate with api.katbot.ai via SIWE.
3. List existing portfolios or create a new Hyperliquid one.
4. Save `KATBOT_HL_AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY`, `katbot_config.json`, and `katbot_token.json` to `~/.openclaw/workspace/katbot-identity/`.
5. Print instructions for authorizing the agent wallet on Hyperliquid.

After onboarding, the skill runs autonomously using the saved credentials. `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` is no longer needed unless the session fully expires.

## Upgrade

When the skill is updated (new version published to clawhub):

```bash
# Re-run ensure_env.sh — it detects the version change and re-installs dependencies
bash {baseDir}/tools/ensure_env.sh {baseDir}
```

No re-onboarding is needed for upgrades. The identity files in `~/.openclaw/workspace/katbot-identity/` are preserved across upgrades. If a tool fails after upgrade, run `ensure_env.sh` first.
