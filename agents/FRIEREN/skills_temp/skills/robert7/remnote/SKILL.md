# RemNote via remnote-cli

Use this skill when a user wants to read or manage RemNote content from the command line with `remnote-cli`.

If the user needs navigation across the whole knowledge base (for example: "where does this topic live in my notes?",
"start from top-level note tree", "map main note groups"), prefer `remnote-kb-navigation` when it is available and
customized for the current user, then return to this skill for general command policy and write gating. If
`remnote-kb-navigation` is not available (or still template/unconfigured), continue with this skill alone and ask for
skill customization when needed.

## Example Conversation Triggers

- "Check if RemNote bridge is connected."
- "Search my RemNote for sprint notes."
- "Find notes tagged weekly-review in RemNote."
- "Read this RemNote by ID: `<rem-id>`."
- "Map the top-level structure of my whole RemNote knowledge base."
- "Create a RemNote note titled X with this content." (requires `confirm write`)
- "Append this to my journal in RemNote." (requires `confirm write`)

## Preconditions (required)

1. RemNote Automation Bridge plugin is installed in RemNote.
2. Plugin install path is one of:
   - Marketplace install guide:
     `https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-bridge/blob/main/docs/guides/install-plugin-via-marketplace-beginner.md`
   - Local dev plugin guide:
     `https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-bridge/blob/main/docs/guides/development-run-plugin-locally.md`
3. `remnote-cli` is installed on the same machine where OpenClaw runs.
   - Preferred install: `npm install -g remnote-cli`
4. RemNote is open in browser/app (`https://www.remnote.com/`).
5. `remnote-cli` daemon is running (`remnote-cli daemon start`).
6. The plugin panel is open in RemNote right sidebar and shows connected status.

If any precondition is missing, stop and fix setup first.

## Read-First Safety Policy

- Default to read-only flows: `status`, `search`, `search-tag`, `read`, `daemon status`.
- Do not run mutating commands by default.
- For writes (`create`, `update`, `journal`), require the exact phrase `confirm write` from the user in the same turn.
- If `confirm write` is not present, ask for confirmation and do not execute writes.

## Command Invocation Rule (critical)

- Run exactly one `remnote-cli` command per execution.
- Invoke `remnote-cli` directly; do not chain shell commands.
- Do not use `&&`, `|`, `;`, subshells (`(...)`), command substitution (`$()`), `xargs`, or `echo` pipelines.
- WRONG: `remnote-cli daemon status --text && echo '---' && remnote-cli status --text`
- RIGHT: `remnote-cli daemon status --text`
- RIGHT: `remnote-cli status --text`
- Reason: command chaining can trigger exec approvals and break automation flow.

## Write Payload Rule (allowlist-friendly)

- For write commands, prefer file-based payload flags:
  - `--content-file <path|->` for `create` / `journal`
  - `--append-file <path|->` or `--replace-file <path|->` for `update`
- Keep executed command strings short and predictable for OpenClaw allowlisting.
- Inline `--content` / `--append` and positional `journal [content]` are discouraged except for very short single-line
  text.
- `-` (stdin) is supported but discouraged by default in OpenClaw flows because command context can be less explicit.

## Compatibility Check (mandatory before real work)

1. Check daemon and bridge connectivity:
   - `remnote-cli daemon status --text`
   - `remnote-cli status --text`
2. Confirm plugin panel is open in right sidebar and connected.
3. Read versions from `remnote-cli status --text`:
   - active plugin version
   - CLI version
   - `version_warning` (if present)
   - write-policy flags: `acceptWriteOperations`, `acceptReplaceOperation`
4. Enforce version rule: bridge plugin and `remnote-cli` must be the same `0.x` minor line (prefer exact match).
5. If mismatch:
   - Install matching CLI version:
     - Exact: `npm install -g remnote-cli@<plugin-version>`
     - Or same minor line (`0.<minor>.x`) when exact is unavailable.
   - Re-run:
     - `remnote-cli --version`
     - `remnote-cli daemon restart` is not available, so run:
       - `remnote-cli daemon stop`
       - `remnote-cli daemon start`
     - `remnote-cli status --text`

## Core Commands

### Health and Connectivity

- `remnote-cli daemon start`
- `remnote-cli daemon status --text`
- `remnote-cli status --text`

### Read-Only Operations (default)

- Search notes: `remnote-cli search "query"`
- Search by tag: `remnote-cli search-tag "tag"`
- Read note by Rem ID: `remnote-cli read <rem-id>`
- Optional text mode: add `--text`

## Output Mode and Traversal Strategy

- Use JSON output (default) for navigation, multi-step retrieval, and any flow that needs IDs for follow-up reads.
- Use `--text` only for plain human summarization of exactly one note when no further navigation is needed.
- For structure traversal, start with shallow reads and high child limit:
  - `remnote-cli read <rem-id> --depth 1 --child-limit 500`

### `--include-content` modes

- `--include-content markdown`:
  - Returns readable rendered child content.
  - Best for summarization/presentation.
  - Markdown content does not provide child IDs required for further navigation.
- `--include-content structured`:
  - Returns hierarchical `contentStructured` data including child rem IDs.
  - Best for navigation and deterministic ID-first traversal.

### Mutating Operations (only after `confirm write`)

- Create (preferred): `remnote-cli create "Title" --content-file /tmp/body.md --text`
- Update (preferred): `remnote-cli update <rem-id> --title "New Title" --append-file /tmp/append.md --text`
- Update replace (destructive, preferred only with explicit user intent):
  - `remnote-cli update <rem-id> --replace-file /tmp/replacement.md --text`
  - `remnote-cli update <rem-id> --replace "" --text` (clear all direct children)
- Journal (preferred): `remnote-cli journal --content-file /tmp/entry.md --text`
- Fallbacks (discouraged): inline flags or positional `journal [content]` for short single-line text only.
- Safety:
  - Never combine append and replace flags in one command.
  - Run replace only when `acceptWriteOperations=true` and `acceptReplaceOperation=true` from `status`.
  - Treat replace as destructive and require the user to clearly request replace semantics.

## Failure Handling

- Daemon unreachable (exit code `2`): start daemon and retry.
- Bridge not connected: open RemNote, open right sidebar plugin panel, verify connected state, retry `status`.
- Version mismatch warning: align `remnote-cli` version to plugin `0.x` minor line, then restart daemon.

## Operational Notes

- JSON output is default and preferred for automation.
- `--text` is useful for quick human checks.
- Reference command docs when unsure:
