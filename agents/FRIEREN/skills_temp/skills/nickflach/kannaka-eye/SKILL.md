  Glyph viewer that renders the SGA geometric fingerprint of any data as a

# Kannaka Eye Skill

See the geometry of information. Every piece of data has an intrinsic
geometric fingerprint when viewed through the lens of SGA. Kannaka Eye
makes these hidden patterns visible as living, breathing glyphs.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** on PATH
- That's it. No npm install, no build step.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start the glyph viewer
./scripts/eye.sh start

# Start on a custom port
./scripts/eye.sh start --port 4444

# Check status
./scripts/eye.sh status

# Stop
./scripts/eye.sh stop
```

Open `http://localhost:3333` in your browser.

## Input Methods

- **Text** — type or paste any text; glyph updates in real-time as you type
- **File upload** — drag & drop or click to upload any file (images, audio, code, binaries)
- **Preset examples** — built-in samples demonstrating different SGA class signatures
- **URL share links** — open a glyph from a URL-encoded share link

## Rendering Layers

The viewer renders 6 canvas layers, composited in real-time:

| Layer | Name | What It Shows |
|-------|------|---------------|
| 1 | Deep Background | Fano plane skeleton — 7 nodes, 7 lines |
| 2 | Fold Path | Primary visual flow via Bezier curves through SGA space |
| 3 | Fano Energy Bloom | 7 radiating petals — energy distribution across Fano lines |
| 4 | Geometric Core | Dominant SGA class sigil — the glyph's "face" |
| 5 | Resonance Rings | Concentric depth distribution across context levels |
| 6 | Metadata Overlay | Fano signatures, SGA centroids, musical frequencies (toggleable) |

## SGA Mathematics

Built on the 84-class system: `Cl₀,₇ ⊗ ℝ[ℤ₄] ⊗ ℝ[ℤ₃]`

| Component | Range | Meaning |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| h₂ | 0–3 | Frequency band (bass, tenor, alto, soprano) |
| d | 0–2 | Modality (experienced, learned, imagined) |
| ℓ | 0–6 | Context slot — Fano plane line index |

**Fano Lines:** 7 oriented triples forming the geometric backbone.
Each line connects 3 of the 7 points in the smallest finite projective plane (PG(2,2)).

**Fold Sequences:** Paths through the 84-class space showing how data evolves
across geometric neighborhoods. Rendered as flowing Bezier curves.

## Export

- **Save as PNG** — 2x resolution canvas export
- **Save Glyph Data** — JSON with fold sequence, Fano signature, SGA centroid, frequencies
- **Copy Share Link** — URL-encoded glyph for sharing (small data only)

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `EYE_PORT` | `3333` | HTTP port for the viewer |
| `FLUX_URL` | — | Flux instance URL (enables event publishing) |
| `FLUX_AGENT_ID` | `kannaka-eye` | Agent ID for Flux events |

## Architecture

Single-file Node.js server (`server.js`) with inline HTML/CSS/JS — the
complete SGA implementation is self-contained. No npm dependencies.
The SGA classifier is ported from kannaka-radio and generalized for
arbitrary data types.

## Notes

- All rendering happens client-side — the server only classifies input and serves the page
- File uploads are processed in-memory; nothing is persisted server-side
- The viewer is designed for local/trusted network use — no authentication
- Glyph appearance is deterministic: same input always produces the same glyph
- Dark cosmic theme (#050508) with purple accents (#c084fc) and golden-ratio color spacing
