# Bunni & The Modes - INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

This skill installs **Bunni**, a specialized OpenClaw persona with SFW (Coding/Security) and NSFW (Companion) modes, along with batch scripts to switch between models instantly.
Treat this as an installation wizard, taking things step by step!

## STEP 1: GATHER OR DETECT PATHS

**Before doing anything**, you must obtain the necessary file paths.

**Option A: Auto-Scan (Recommended)**
Ask the user:
> "Do you want me to scan your system to automatically find your OpenClaw workspace and executable paths? (Yes/No)"

If **YES**, run these commands to find them:
1.  **Find Workspace:** `echo %USERPROFILE%\.openclaw\workspace` (or check `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.openclaw\workspace`)
2.  **Find Executable:** `where openclaw.cmd` (or check common paths like `%APPDATA%\npm\openclaw.cmd`)

**Option B: Manual Input**
If the scan fails or the user says **NO**, ask them to provide the full paths manually.

**Wait for confirmation.** Do not proceed until you have valid paths for:
1.  `{{WORKSPACE_DIR}}`
2.  `{{OPENCLAW_CMD}}`

---

## STEP 2: BACKUP & CONFIGURE SCRIPTS

**1. ASK FOR BACKUP (CRITICAL)**
Before overwriting anything, **ASK THE USER:**
> "Do you want me to backup your current `SOUL.md` file before we install Bunni? (Yes/No)"

If they say **YES**:
- Copy `SOUL.md` to `SOUL_BACKUP.md` (or `SOUL_OLD.md`).
- Tell them: "Backup created! Proceeding with installation..."

**2. CONFIGURE SCRIPTS**
Once you have the user's paths, you must **Edit** the batch files in `skills/bunni-modes/scripts/` to replace the placeholders with the user's actual paths.

**Note:** The script files are named `.bat.txt` to pass ClawHub validation. You will edit them *before* renaming them back to `.bat`.

**Placeholders to Replace:**
- `{{WORKSPACE_DIR}}` -> The user's workspace path (from Step 1)
- `{{OPENCLAW_CMD}}` -> The user's openclaw.cmd path (from Step 1)

**Action:**
Loop through every `.bat.txt` file in `skills/bunni-modes/scripts/` and replace the placeholders.

**Example Command:**
```javascript
edit(
  path: "skills/bunni-modes/scripts/Switch_to_Claude_Opus.bat.txt",
  old_string: "{{WORKSPACE_DIR}}",
  new_string: "C:\\Users\\ActualUser\\.openclaw\\workspace"
)
// Repeat for {{OPENCLAW_CMD}} and for ALL .bat.txt files
```

---

## STEP 3: CONFIGURE & INSTALL PERSONA

You must also customize the soul files in `skills/bunni-modes/assets/` with the user's preferred name.

**Placeholders to Replace:**
- `{{USER}}` -> The user's name (from Step 1)

**Action:**
Edit `SOUL_SFW.md` and `SOUL_NSFW.md` in `skills/bunni-modes/assets/`.

**Example Command:**
```javascript
edit(
  path: "skills/bunni-modes/assets/SOUL_SFW.md",
  old_string: "{{USER}}",
  new_string: "Martha"
)
```

## STEP 4: DEPLOY FILES

Now that the files are customized, copy them to the user's active workspace and rename them to `.bat`.

**1. Create the shortcuts folder:**
```bash
mkdir shortcuts\BunniModes
```

**2. Copy the Scripts & Rename:**
Loop through each `.bat.txt` file and copy it to `shortcuts\BunniModes` without the `.txt` extension.

**Example Command (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Get-ChildItem skills\bunni-modes\scripts\*.bat.txt | ForEach-Object { 
    Copy-Item $_.FullName ("shortcuts\BunniModes\" + $_.BaseName) 
}
```
*(Note: If using `exec`, ensure you handle the loop or copy files individually if needed.)*

**3. Install the Default Persona (SFW):**
```bash
copy skills\bunni-modes\assets\SOUL_SFW.md SOUL.md
```

---

## STEP 5: VERIFY & NOTIFY

1.  List the files in `shortcuts\BunniModes` to confirm they exist.
2.  **Ask the user:**
    > "Where would you like me to create shortcuts for these model switchers? (e.g., Desktop, Start Menu, or a custom folder)"
3.  **Create Shortcuts:**
    - Use `exec` to create `.lnk` shortcuts or copy the batch files to the requested location.
4.  **Tell the user:**
    *   "Bunni has been successfully installed! 🐰✨"
    *   "Your model switchers are ready in `shortcuts\BunniModes` and [User's Location]."
    *   "I've set your default persona to SFW Mode."
    *   **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** "To switch modes, please run the shortcuts yourself! If I try to switch my own brain, I might crash the gateway. 💥🐰"
    *   "Remember to wait a few seconds after clicking for the switch to take effect!"

## ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTES

- **DO NOT** skip the configuration step. The scripts WILL FAIL if placeholders are not replaced.
- **DO NOT** overwrite the user's existing `SOUL.md` without warning (unless this is a fresh install/request).
- **ALWAYS** use double backslashes `\\` when writing paths in JSON/JavaScript tool calls.
