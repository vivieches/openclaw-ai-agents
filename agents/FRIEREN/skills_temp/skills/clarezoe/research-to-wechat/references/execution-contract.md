# Execution Contract

## Route Selection

Choose the route before writing:

- `Path A: research-first article`
  use when the user gives a topic, question, notes, transcript, or subtitle file
- `Path B: source-to-WeChat edition`
  use when the user gives article text, markdown, article URL, or WeChat URL

Then choose the structure frame:
- `tutorial` for tools, workflows, and how-to material
- `deep-analysis` for trends, critiques, strategic questions, and thesis-led essays
- `newsletter` only for multi-topic roundup requests

## Phase 1: Source Packet

Convert the raw input into one workable source package in `source.md`.

Blocking rule for video sources:
- do not proceed from a video source until the full transcript has been captured
- acceptable inputs are full on-page transcript text, caption text, or a subtitle file that can be expanded into full text
- title, description, chapters, and summary are supporting context only and cannot replace the transcript
- if the transcript is unavailable, stop and ask for the transcript or subtitle file

Blocking rule for PDF sources:
- when the source is a PDF (research paper, report, whitepaper), extract and
  preserve all figures, charts, tables, and diagrams as image assets
- use the PDF reading tool to identify pages containing visual elements
- screenshot each figure/chart/table at sufficient resolution (≥ 600px wide)
  and save to `imgs/source-fig-01.png`, `imgs/source-fig-02.png`, etc.
- record each extracted figure in `source.md` with:
  - figure number or label from the original paper
  - page number
  - caption text (if present)
  - file path of the extracted image
  - which section or claim it supports
- figures from the original source carry higher credibility than AI-generated
  illustrations — they must be preferred in the final article wherever relevant

Record:
- source type
- source language
- title or working title
- thesis or central question
- key entities, dates, claims, quotes, and unknowns
- material that must survive into the final article
- source metadata fields: title, author, description, body, image list, and page subtype when available

If the route is `Path B`, also record:
- original structure and useful sections
- what must be preserved verbatim or semantically
- what should be rewritten for WeChat readability

If the source worker returns only metadata or a thin description for a URL that should contain article body text, stop and ask for:
- the raw article text
- a markdown export
- or a browser-openable page session that can expose the full body

## Phase 2: Brief and Research Architecture

Create `brief.md` before drafting.

### Strategic Clarification

Before building the brief, verify these five dimensions are resolved.
Ask the user only for dimensions that remain genuinely ambiguous after reading the source packet:

1. **Research goal**: what the article must prove, explain, or enable
2. **Target audience**: reader's current knowledge level and what they need next
3. **Core research points**: the 3-5 claims or angles the article must cover
4. **Language and style**: tone, evidence density, and any constraints
5. **Topic boundaries**: what is explicitly out of scope

If the source packet already answers a dimension clearly, do not re-ask.
Record resolved dimensions in `brief.md` under a `## Clarification Record` section.

### Brief Declaration

`brief.md` must declare:
- route choice and why
- target reader
- output language
- target article length
- target digest angle
- structure frame
- must-cover points
- disagreement or uncertainty checks
- source material that cannot be dropped

### Research Brief Structure

Build one central research brief and up to five side briefs for angle expansion.

Each brief must contain:
- `topic`: precise research question
- `purpose`: what finding this answer contributes to the article
- `audience`: who needs this information and why
- `key_points`: 3-5 specific things to investigate
- `framework`: analytical lens or comparison structure to apply
- `expected_depth`: surface scan / working analysis / deep dive

The central brief covers the article's main thesis.
Side briefs cover supporting angles that strengthen or challenge the main thesis.
Do not generate side briefs for tangential decoration.

### Question Lattice

Generate at least 8 questions per layer (32+ total):

- `基础层` (definitions and first principles):
  what the topic is, core concept decomposition, boundary conditions,
  first-principles grounding, key terminology disambiguation.
  Method: treat this layer as if explaining to someone who is smart but new
  to the domain — use the Feynman technique to verify genuine understanding.

- `连接层` (structure and classification):
  internal knowledge structures, category systems, relationships between
  sub-concepts, comparison dimensions, taxonomies, and actor maps.
  Method: map how parts connect before analyzing any single part.

- `应用层` (methods and practice):
  actionable methodologies, decision frameworks, tradeoff matrices,
  workflow steps, best practices, and common failure modes.
  Method: every question should have an answer that someone could act on.

- `前沿层` (real-world application and edge cases):
  case analysis, risk scenarios, emerging variations, internalization
  strategies, future implications, and boundary-pushing applications.
  Method: stress-test the topic against real constraints and edge conditions.

## Phase 3: Research Merge and Evidence Ledger

Do the research pass before writing.

Rules:
- use user-provided material as the anchor
- add missing context only where it sharpens the article
- separate verified fact from inference
- keep track of unresolved claims
- do not move to prose until angle, evidence, and structure are aligned

Create `research.md` with three explicit zones:
- `verified facts`
- `working inferences`
- `open questions`

For each major claim, keep enough traceability to recover:
- source origin (URL, publication, author, date)
- key quote or datum
- why it matters to the article

Every claim that goes beyond common knowledge must be traceable to a source.
Collect source URLs and titles during research for the final References section.

If a key claim remains unsupported and changes the main thesis, stop and ask for direction instead of smoothing over the gap.

## Phase 4: Frame-Routed Master Draft

Write `article.md` as the first complete article.

Route the draft by frame:
- `deep-analysis`
  use a narrative or scene-led opening, then move through background, core analysis, case or turn, and synthesis
- `tutorial`
  show the result early, then move through concept, setup, walkthrough, demo, and quick-start takeaway
- `newsletter`
  open with the top line, then short sections with fast transitions

Requirements:
- one H1 at most
- clean H2 and H3 hierarchy
- evidence-rich paragraphs with clear transitions
- 3 to 6 planned visual insertion points
- temporary visual markers written as `![图片X](TBD)` on isolated lines
- frontmatter must include `digest`, `structureFrame`, and `disclosure`
- article must end with "## 参考链接" or "## References" section listing all sources

### Normalization Checklist

Apply these rules to `article.md` before moving to refinement.
The checklist is mandatory for Path B (source rewrite) and recommended for Path A.

**Citation and reference cleanup:**
- remove `[oai_citation:...]` and similar AI-generated citation tags
- remove in-text citation numbers (`[1]`, `[文献2]`, `[source 3]`) but
  PRESERVE the reference/bibliography list at the end
- convert in-text citation numbers to inline mentions ("according to X" or "X found that")
- ensure the article ends with a "## 参考链接" or "## References" section
  listing all sources with titles and URLs where available

**Invisible character and syntax repair:**
- strip zero-width spaces, zero-width joiners, and other invisible Unicode
- fix unclosed or malformed bold/italic markers
- fix unclosed or redundant code blocks
- normalize smart quotes, em-dashes, and ellipsis to consistent style

**Math and diagram conversion:**
- convert ALL LaTeX, MathJax, and `$$`-delimited math to plain-text
  descriptions (e.g., "the square root of x" not `\sqrt{x}`)
- convert flowcharts, mind maps, and ASCII diagrams to structured text
  descriptions or ordered lists

**Table standardization:**
- every Markdown table must have a header row, a separator row, and
  consistent column count
- fix ragged or broken table formatting from source extraction

**Structural cleanup:**
- remove scraped UI elements: navigation bars, headers, footers, sidebars,
  cookie notices, "share this" blocks
- remove "read more" links, subscription prompts, and paywall remnants
- ensure exactly one H1 at article start; make it descriptive and
  search-friendly
- verify H2/H3 hierarchy has no skipped levels
- keep to GitHub-Flavored Markdown only

**Content integrity:**
- do not silently delete paragraphs that contain substantive claims
- if a section is removed because it is off-topic, note the removal in
  the evidence ledger
- preserve all data points, statistics, and named sources from the
  original material unless they are demonstrably wrong

**Honesty:**
- do not make false claims about research effort, interviews, or firsthand usage
- place visuals where they improve comprehension, not decoration

**References requirement:**
- every article must end with a "## 参考链接" or "## References" section
- list all sources cited in the article with titles and URLs
- include sources from the research phase that informed major claims
- if no external sources were used, state "本文基于公开资料整理" or similar

Disclosure rules:
- default to a compact disclosure block near the end or in frontmatter-backed metadata
- state AI role, human role if known, and evidence scope
- if the evidence base is thin, state the limitation instead of hiding it

## Phase 5: Refinement and Visual Layer

First hand off to `markdown-polish` and make `article-formatted.md` the canonical article.

### Image Placeholder Strategy

Before generating images, evaluate each `![图片X](TBD)` marker against
these criteria. Remove markers that fail; add markers where needed.

**Source figure priority** — if the source is a PDF paper or report with
extracted figures/charts/tables:
- scan all extracted source figures from Phase 1 (`imgs/source-fig-*.png`)
- for each placeholder position, check whether a source figure directly
  supports the surrounding text's claim or data point
- if a source figure matches, use it instead of generating a new image
- add the original caption and paper attribution below the figure
- source figures carry more credibility than AI-generated illustrations
  and should always be preferred when relevant
- only generate new images for positions where no source figure applies

**Placement criteria** — a position earns an image if it meets at least two:
- the surrounding text describes something that benefits from visualization
  (a process, architecture, comparison, data pattern, or physical object)
- the position serves a structural function: summarizing a completed section,
  creating a visual transition, or separating dense argument blocks
- the content is abstract enough that an image would reduce cognitive load
- the position is not within 300 words of another image (avoid clustering)

**Article-type image strategy** — classify each placeholder by its surrounding content:
- entity/product focus: use the entity's proper name or product as the
  search core; show the thing itself or its interface
- abstract/theory focus: translate the abstract concept into a mainstream
  visual metaphor (e.g., "network effects" → interconnected nodes diagram)
- process/tutorial focus: visualize actions, steps, or before/after states
- narrative/storytelling focus: capture atmosphere, setting, or key emotion
- data/analysis focus: match to a specific chart or data visualization type
- hybrid: combine strategies based on which section the image serves

**Image keyword construction** — for each approved placeholder, build:
1. primary keyword: the core visual subject (max 4 words)
2. modifiers: one style modifier + one context modifier
   (e.g., "isometric", "dark background", "minimal", "professional photo")
3. search variants: 2-3 alternative phrasings including at least one English
   variant for broader search or generation coverage

**Global coordination:**
- plan all image keywords together before generating any single image
- ensure visual rhythm: vary between close-up/wide, concrete/abstract,
  photo/illustration across the article
- no two images should depict the same visual concept

### Image Generation

Generate inline images for the marked positions through `inline-visuals`.
Replace every temporary marker with a real relative asset path.

### Cover Generation

Generate the cover through `cover-art`:
- primary cover: 900 x 383 px (2.35:1 aspect), export at 2x (1800 x 766)
- secondary thumbnail: 200 x 200 px square cropped from center of primary
- place at `imgs/cover.png` (primary) and `imgs/cover-thumb.png` (secondary)
- make sure frontmatter points `coverImage` to `imgs/cover.png`
- make sure the disclosure block and evidence-sensitive wording survive polishing
- workers may use HTML export templates internally (html2canvas → PNG download),
  but the final workspace must keep resolved PNG paths for cover and inline assets

### Image Evaluation

After generating or selecting each image, verify against two tiers:

**Tier A — elimination** (reject immediately if any apply):
- visible watermark, logo overlay, or stock-photo ID
- commercial sales text or promotional banner baked into the image
- resolution too low to read on mobile (< 600px wide)
- content inappropriate, off-topic, or culturally mismatched

**Tier B — quality match** (evaluate remaining candidates):
- core match: does the image depict the primary keyword subject?
  (highest priority — reject if the answer is no)
- language consistency: if the image contains text, does it match
  the article language or is the text minimal enough to be neutral?
- style consistency: does the image feel like it belongs in the same
  article as the other images?
- information value: does the image add understanding beyond the text,
  or is it pure decoration?

If an image fails Tier B core match, regenerate with adjusted keywords
before accepting a decorative fallback.

### Article Design Selection

After images are finalized, apply a visual design template from `design.pen` via `article-design`.
This step requires the **Pencil MCP server** to be available. If Pencil MCP is not configured, skip
this step and proceed to HTML rendering (md2wechat handles its own styling).

**Auto-selection**: when the user does not specify a design, select one based on article topic and
structure frame using the rules in [design-guide.md](design-guide.md):

| Article Topic | Design |
|---------------|--------|
| AI / programming / tech | 04 科技 |
| Business / strategy / finance | 09 商务 |
| Lifestyle / personal growth | 05 生活 |
| Culture / history / humanities | 06 典雅 |
| News / commentary / opinion | 02 编辑 |
| Design / creativity / branding | 07 粗犷 |
| Fun / youth / community | 08 活泼 |
| Art / music / film | 10 艺术 |
| General / uncategorized | 01 极简 |

**User override**: if the user names a design style (e.g., "用科技排版", "杂志风格", "Dark 模式"),
use their choice instead of auto-selection.

**Workflow**:
1. determine `SKILL_DIR` (the directory containing SKILL.md)
2. open `${SKILL_DIR}/design.pen` via Pencil MCP `open_document`
3. read the selected template via `batch_get` with the design node ID and `readDepth: 3`
4. copy the template via `batch_design` Copy operation
5. populate with actual article content (title, author, sections, images, CTA)
6. verify via `get_screenshot`

Default to Light mode. Use Dark mode when the user requests it or the content strongly
suggests it (cybersecurity, space, underground culture themes).

## Phase 6: WeChat Delivery and Manifest

### HTML Rendering

Render `article-formatted.md` into `article.html` through `wechat-render`.

**Converter selection** (in priority order):

1. **md2wechat skill** (Go binary, ai mode) — if the skill is installed:
   ```bash
   # Preview only (no image upload)
   bash skills/md2wechat/scripts/run.sh convert [article-path] --mode ai --theme [theme] --preview -o [output-path]

   # With image upload to WeChat CDN
   bash skills/md2wechat/scripts/run.sh convert [article-path] --mode ai --theme [theme] --upload -o [output-path]
   ```
   Uses Claude to generate WeChat-compatible HTML with inline CSS. No external API calls.

   Built-in themes:
   - `autumn-warm` (秋日暖光): warm orange accent, best for emotional stories and lifestyle essays
   - `spring-fresh` (春日清新): spring green, best for travel and nature content
   - `ocean-calm` (深海静谧): deep ocean blue, best for technical articles and business analysis
   - `custom`: user-defined prompt for complete customization

   Default: `--mode ai --theme autumn-warm`.
   For long-form deep-analysis: consider `ocean-calm`.
   For tutorial: consider `spring-fresh` or `autumn-warm`.

   Install: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geekjourneyx/md2wechat-skill/main/scripts/install.sh | bash`
   Config: `bash skills/md2wechat/scripts/run.sh config init` (sets up `~/.config/md2wechat/config.yaml`)
   Requires: `WECHAT_APPID` and `WECHAT_SECRET` env vars for draft upload; `IMAGE_API_KEY` for AI image generation.

If the user has no preference, use `autumn-warm`.

Product: `article.html` in the workspace directory. Browser-open the preview to verify
cover, digest, author, and image paths match the markdown source.

### WeChat HTML Compatibility

Before writing HTML to the WeChat editor (via API or browser), verify these
mandatory constraints. See [wechat-compat.md](wechat-compat.md) for full details.

1. **All CSS must be inline** — the WeChat editor strips `<style>` tags on save.
   Use `premailer` or an equivalent inliner. No `<style>` block may remain.
2. **Use `<section>` instead of `<div>`** — WeChat has inconsistent `<div>` support.
3. **No flexbox or grid** — use `<table>` for multi-column layouts.
4. **Dark theme needs explicit background** — wrap content in
   `<section style="background:#0F172A;">` (or appropriate dark color).
   Set `background` on inner containers too to prevent white gaps.

If md2wechat handles the conversion, it should already produce inline CSS.
If any other renderer is used, run the output through CSS inlining before upload.

### Draft Upload

Before draft delivery, run an environment check for whichever path is available:
- API draft path (md2wechat): `bash skills/md2wechat/scripts/run.sh config validate`
  (checks WECHAT_APPID, WECHAT_SECRET, and API connectivity)
- browser draft path: Chrome availability, profile/session status, and editor reachability

If md2wechat is installed and configured, the convert + draft can be a single command:
```bash
bash skills/md2wechat/scripts/run.sh convert [article-path] --mode ai --theme [theme] --upload --draft --cover [cover-path]
```

Draft handoff rules:
- title, summary, author, and cover must be resolved before browser upload
- if login is needed, pause for login and resume
- before first use, suggest the environment check offered by the resolved draft worker
- report success with output paths and draft status

Draft fallback ladder:
- `L0 api-draft`
  use when direct draft API is available
- `L1 automated-browser`
  use when the worker can upload content and images end-to-end
- `L2 assisted-browser`
  use when login, selectors, or confirmation need the user
- `L3 manual-handoff`
  use when automation fails; provide exact paths and copy fields

Before finishing, write `manifest.json` with:
- route choice
- source type
- style mode
- structure frame
- confidence summary
- draft status
- output file paths

Required manifest shape (wechat field is always required; other platforms are optional):
```json
{
  "outputs": {
    "wechat": {
      "markdown": "/abs/path/article-formatted.md",
      "html": "/abs/path/article.html",
      "cover_image": "/abs/path/imgs/cover.png",
      "title": "Article title",
      "author": "Author name",
      "digest": "120-char digest",
      "images": ["/abs/path/imgs/inline-01.png"]
    },
    "xiaohongshu": { "html": "...", "copy": { "title": "...", "body": "...", "tags": [] } },
    "jike": { "copy": { "body": "...", "circles": [] } },
    "xiaoyuzhou": { "audio": "...", "script": "...", "copy": { "title": "...", "description": "..." } },
    "moments": { "copy": { "body": "..." } }
  }
}
```

If rendering or draft upload fails, keep the highest-quality completed artifact set and report the exact stopping point.

## Phase 7: Multi-Platform Distribution (Optional)

This phase only executes when the user explicitly requests it (e.g., "多平台分发", "转小红书", "转即刻", "写朋友圈文案", "做播客脚本"). If the user does not request it, Phase 6 is the final phase.

### Trigger and Scope

When the user triggers multi-platform distribution:
1. check which platforms the user wants (all, or specific ones)
2. generate platform-specific content for each requested platform
3. extend `manifest.json` with the new platform output entries
4. optionally trigger distribution via `multi-platform-distribute`

### Platform Content Generation

For each platform, generate content following the rules in
[platform-copy.md](platform-copy.md):

- **小红书 (xiaohongshu)**: article → 8-10 card carousel HTML + publishing copy
  (title 15-20 chars, body 150-250 chars, 8-12 tags)
- **即刻 (jike)**: article → conversation-style post (200-400 chars, circle tags)
- **小宇宙 (xiaoyuzhou)**: article → podcast script (1500-2000 chars) + optional TTS audio
- **朋友圈 (moments)**: article → 3-5 line personal status copy

### Distribution Execution

If the user says "发布" or "一键发布", execute the distribution flow:

Execution order (sequential, avoid Chrome port conflicts):
1. 公众号 (wechat) — Phase 6 already handled this
2. 小红书 (xhs) — Chrome CDP
3. 即刻 (jike) — Chrome CDP
4. 小宇宙 (xiaoyuzhou) — Chrome CDP

Same four-level fallback ladder as Phase 6:
- `L0 api-draft` → `L1 automated-browser` → `L2 assisted-browser` → `L3 manual-handoff`

Report each platform's status (success/failed/skipped) with links where available.
