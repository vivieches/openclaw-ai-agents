# Document Skills

Produce or update a skill so it follows Claude Code best practices. Apply the following to the target skill directory.

## Inputs

1. **Target skill** – Path to the skill directory (e.g. `.claude/skills/example/`) or the skill name. If omitted, use the current or specified context.
2. **Source** – Optional. Draft, user instructions, or research to turn into or merge into the skill.

## Output

SKILL.md and optional supporting files updated per structure and checklist below.

## Process

### Skill structure

- One directory per skill; required file: `SKILL.md`.
- **Where**: Project = `.claude/skills/<name>/`; personal = `~/.claude/skills/<name>/`. Nested `.claude/skills/` (e.g. in a package) are discovered automatically.
- Optional: `template.md`, `examples/`, `scripts/`. Reference them from `SKILL.md` so Claude knows when to load them.
- **Length**: Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines; move long reference to supporting files (e.g. `reference.md`, `examples.md`).

### SKILL.md format

#### Frontmatter (YAML between `---`)

| Field | Use |
|-------|-----|
| `name` | Optional. Lowercase, letters, numbers, hyphens only (max 64 chars). Defaults to directory name. Becomes `/slash-command`. |
| `description` | **Recommended.** What the skill does and when to use it; include phrases users would say so Claude can auto-invoke. If omitted, uses the first paragraph of markdown content. |
| `argument-hint` | Optional. Shown in autocomplete (e.g. `[issue-number]`, `[filename] [format]`). |
| `disable-model-invocation` | Set `true` for workflows with side effects or that must run only when the user invokes (e.g. deploy, commit). |
| `user-invocable` | Set `false` to hide from `/` menu; skill is context-only for Claude. |
| `allowed-tools` | Optional. Tools Claude may use without asking when this skill is active. Can use patterns (e.g. `Bash(gh *)`, `Bash(python *)`). |
| `model` | Optional. Model when skill is active. |
| `context` | Set `fork` to run in a forked subagent. Only for skills with explicit instructions (a task), not reference-only content. |
| `agent` | When `context: fork`, which subagent type (e.g. Explore, Plan, general-purpose). |
| `hooks` | Optional. See hooks docs. |

**YAML:** Avoid colons inside frontmatter values. Use a different phrase (e.g. "Scope is" or "Scope includes" instead of "Scope:") so parsers (e.g. GitHub) do not treat them as new keys.

#### Content type

- **Reference** – Conventions, patterns, style guides. Stays inline; Claude uses it in conversation.
- **Task** – Step-by-step; often add `disable-model-invocation: true` and invoke with `/name`.

#### SKILL.md body structure (match existing skills)

Every skill must use the same section layout so skills stay consistent and easy to scan:

1. **# Title** – Skill name as H1, then one short intro paragraph (what the skill does).
2. **## Inputs** – What the skill needs (user input, paths, options). List numbered items. Use "None" or "Optional" if there are no required inputs.
3. **## Output** – What the skill produces or delivers (file, behavior, handoff). One short block.
4. **## Process** – How to do it. Numbered steps or subsections (e.g. "### 1. Step name"). Put all how-to and rules here.
5. **## Reference** – Optional. Links to related skills, docs, or paths (e.g. `[other-skill](../other-skill/SKILL.md)`).

Omit a section only if it truly does not apply (e.g. a pure reference skill might have no Process steps). When in doubt, include all five. Align new or updated skills with this structure and with other skills in the same repo.

#### Substitutions (in body)

- `$ARGUMENTS` – All arguments; if absent, arguments are appended as `ARGUMENTS: `.
- `$ARGUMENTS[N]` or `$N` – Argument by 0-based index.
- `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` – Session ID.
- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` – Skill directory (e.g. for scripts).

### Checklist when writing or updating a skill

1. **Frontmatter and discovery**: `description` present and specific, with natural keywords and when-to-use; `name` matches intent; `disable-model-invocation: true` for task-only or side-effect skills.
2. **Body structure**: SKILL.md includes (as applicable) Inputs, Output, Process, Reference in that order; matches the same layout as other skills in the repo.
3. **Length**: Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines; long reference in separate files, linked from `SKILL.md`.
4. **Supporting files**: Mention in `SKILL.md` with clear when-to-load guidance.
5. **Arguments**: If the skill takes inputs, use `$ARGUMENTS` or `$N` and optionally `argument-hint`.
6. **Invocation**: Set `disable-model-invocation` and/or `user-invocable` per desired (user-only, Claude-only, or both).

1. Read the target skill path and any provided source material.
2. Apply the checklist and the structure above; preserve existing behavior unless the user asks to change it.
3. Write or update `SKILL.md` (and any supporting files if requested).
4. Do not invent capabilities; only document what the skill actually does or is specified to do.
