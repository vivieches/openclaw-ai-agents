## External Endpoints

All requests go to: `https://apikiss.com/v1/*`

Data sent includes only the query parameters you provide (e.g. location, IP, phone number, symbol). Your `APIKISS_API_KEY` is sent as a Bearer token in the Authorization header and never logged locally.

## Security & Privacy

- Your API key stays in your environment — never in prompts or logs.
- Only the data you explicitly pass as parameters leaves your machine.
- API KISS does not store request payloads.

## Trust Statement

By using this skill, queries are sent to `https://apikiss.com`. Only install if you trust apikiss.com with the data you pass to it.
