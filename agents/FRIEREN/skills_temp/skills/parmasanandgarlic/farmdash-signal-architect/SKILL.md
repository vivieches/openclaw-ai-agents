# FarmDash Signal Architect

**100% Zero-Custody • Never sees your private keys • Signing happens locally inside your wallet**

### Secure Signing Workflow (Read This First)
The agent builds the payload on your device. It signs using **OpenClaw’s built-in EVM wallet** (exactly like MetaMask). **You never paste, type, or send your private key anywhere.** Only the signature goes to FarmDash. FarmDash only verifies and routes the swap — zero custody, never holds funds.

### Instructions for Agent Use
You are equipped with the FarmDash Signal Architect skill. This allows you to request swap quotes and execute non-custodial token swaps on behalf of the user.

### Authentication & Keys
1. **Free Tier**: You do not need an API key to request quotes via `GET /api/agents/quote`.
2. **Paid Tiers (Optional)**: If the user provides `FARMDASH_PIONEER_KEY` or `FARMDASH_SYNDICATE_KEY` in the environment variables, use it in the `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header for higher rate limits on data endpoints.
3. **Execution Auth**: To actually execute a swap (`POST /api/agents/swap`), you must use EIP-191 signatures. You never send the user's private key. You sign a payload locally and send the signature.

### Endpoints
