# OpenClaw Integration

Use this only when the user is explicitly building on OpenClaw.

## Integration Pattern

1. Store private values in config or environment variables
2. Keep behavior policy in workspace docs
3. Keep runtime logic in scripts
4. Trigger the companion from scheduled `systemEvent` handlers

## Files To Touch

Typical mapping:
- persona/behavior rules:
  - `SOUL.md`
  - `HEARTBEAT.md`
- runtime script:
  - `workspace/skills/cyber-girlfriend/scripts/companion_ping.py`
  - `workspace/skills/cyber-girlfriend/scripts/sync_companion_cron.py`
- optional share source:
  - `workspace/skills/cyber-girlfriend/scripts/fetch_x_hotspots.py`
- state:
  - `workspace/skills/cyber-girlfriend/state/companion-state.json`
  - `workspace/skills/cyber-girlfriend/state/x-hotspots.json`

## Recommended Local Config

Create a local, non-published config such as:
- `workspace/skills/cyber-girlfriend/config.local.json`

Point it at the user's real:
- owner chat target
- owner session key
- recent session jsonl path
- sessions store path
- generation/send commands
- generation retry policy
- per-mode cron schedule entries

## What Must Stay Configurable

- owner chat target
- owner session key
- generator target/session
- workspace root
- recent message log path
- state paths
- Chrome binary path
- X source URL
- per-mode cron expressions and system events

## Handler Shape

For each scheduled mode, the handler only needs to:
1. invoke the companion script with `morning|afternoon|evening|night`
2. report execution status

Keep the handler thin. Put logic in scripts, not markdown prose.

## Scheduler Sync

Store cron timing under `schedule.cron_jobs` in config.

Use:
- preview commands: `python workspace/skills/cyber-girlfriend/scripts/sync_companion_cron.py --config workspace/skills/cyber-girlfriend/config.local.json`
- apply config to OpenClaw: `python workspace/skills/cyber-girlfriend/scripts/sync_companion_cron.py --config workspace/skills/cyber-girlfriend/config.local.json --apply`

This keeps timing editable in config instead of hardcoded in `SOUL.md` or shell history.

## Safety Notes

- Do not use direct in-turn restart paths for gateway restarts.
- Do not let proactive behavior leak into non-owner chats.
- Do not make outbound sharing/posting actions implicit.
- If local media must be sent, stage it into a runtime-approved workspace directory before calling the outbound message command.
