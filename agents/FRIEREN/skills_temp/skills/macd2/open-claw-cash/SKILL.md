# OpenclawCash Agent API

Interact with OpenclawCash-managed wallets to send native assets and tokens, check balances, and execute agent-safe wallet operations across EVM and Solana networks.

## Requirements

- Required env var: `AGENTWALLETAPI_KEY`
- Optional env var: `AGENTWALLETAPI_URL` (default: `https://openclawcash.com`)
- Required local binary: `curl`
- Optional local binary: `jq` (for pretty JSON output in CLI)
- Network access required: `https://openclawcash.com`

## Preferred Integration Path

- If the client supports MCP, prefer the public OpenClawCash MCP server:
  ```bash
  npx -y @openclawcash/mcp-server
  ```
- Use MCP as the primary execution path because tools, schemas, and results are structured for the client.
- Use the included CLI script only as a fallback when MCP is unavailable or the client cannot attach MCP servers.
- MCP and the CLI script target the same underlying OpenClawCash agent API. They are two access paths, not two different products.

## Safety Model

- Start with read-only calls (`wallets`, `wallet`, `balance`, `tokens`) on testnets first.
- High-risk actions are gated:
  - API key permissions in dashboard (`allowWalletCreation`, `allowWalletImport`)
  - Explicit CLI confirmation (`--yes`) for write actions
- Agents should establish an approval mode early in the session for write actions:
  - `confirm_each_write`: ask before every write action.
  - `operate_on_my_behalf`: after one explicit onboarding approval, execute future write actions without re-asking, as long as the user keeps instructing the agent in the same session.
- For `operate_on_my_behalf`, the agent should treat the user's later task messages as execution instructions and run the corresponding write commands with `--yes`.
- Ask again only if:
  - the user revokes or changes approval mode
  - the session is restarted or memory is lost
  - the action is outside the scope the user approved
  - the agent is unsure which wallet, token, amount, destination, spender, or chain is intended
- If the user gives only a broad instruction like "go ahead" but execution details are still missing, gather the missing details first instead of repeating a generic permission request.

## Setup

1. Run the setup script to create your `.env` file:
   ```
   bash scripts/setup.sh
   ```
2. Edit the `.env` file in this skill folder and replace the placeholder with your real API key:
   ```
   AGENTWALLETAPI_KEY=occ_your_api_key
   ```
3. Get your API key at https://openclawcash.com (sign up, create a wallet, go to API Keys page).

## Legacy CLI Fallback

If MCP is unavailable, use the included tool script to make API calls directly:

```bash
# Read-only (recommended first)
bash scripts/agentwalletapi.sh wallets
bash scripts/agentwalletapi.sh wallet Q7X2K9P
bash scripts/agentwalletapi.sh wallet "Trading Bot"
bash scripts/agentwalletapi.sh balance Q7X2K9P
bash scripts/agentwalletapi.sh transactions Q7X2K9P
bash scripts/agentwalletapi.sh tokens mainnet

# Write actions (require explicit --yes)
export WALLET_EXPORT_PASSPHRASE_OPS='your-strong-passphrase'
bash scripts/agentwalletapi.sh create "Ops Wallet" sepolia WALLET_EXPORT_PASSPHRASE_OPS --yes
bash scripts/agentwalletapi.sh import "Treasury Imported" mainnet --yes
# Automation-safe import: read private key from stdin instead of command args
printf '%s' '<private_key>' | bash scripts/agentwalletapi.sh import "Treasury Imported" mainnet - --yes
bash scripts/agentwalletapi.sh transfer Q7X2K9P 0xRecipient 0.01 --yes
bash scripts/agentwalletapi.sh transfer Q7X2K9P 0xRecipient 100 USDC --yes
bash scripts/agentwalletapi.sh quote mainnet WETH USDC 10000000000000000
bash scripts/agentwalletapi.sh quote solana-mainnet SOL USDC 10000000 solana
bash scripts/agentwalletapi.sh swap Q7X2K9P WETH USDC 10000000000000000 0.5 --yes
```

### Import Input Safety

- Wallet import is optional and not required for normal wallet operations (list, balance, transfer, swap).
- Import works only when the user explicitly enables API key permission `allowWalletImport` in dashboard settings.
- Import execution requires explicit confirmation in the CLI (`--yes` for automation, or interactive `YES` prompt).
- Avoid passing sensitive inputs as CLI arguments when possible (shell history/process logs risk).
- Preferred options:
  - Interactive hidden prompt: omit the private key argument.
  - Automation: pass `-` and pipe input via stdin.

## Base URL

```
https://openclawcash.com
```

## Troubleshooting

If requests fail because of host/URL issues, use this recovery flow:

1. Open `agentwalletapi/.env` and verify `AGENTWALLETAPI_KEY` is set and has no extra spaces.
2. If the API host is wrong or unreachable, set this in the same `.env` file:
   ```
   AGENTWALLETAPI_URL=https://openclawcash.com
   ```
3. Retry a simple read call first:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/agentwalletapi.sh wallets
   ```
4. If it still fails, report the exact error and stop before attempting transfer/swap actions.

## Authentication

The API key is loaded from the `.env` file in this skill folder. For direct HTTP calls, include it as a header:

```
X-Agent-Key: occ_your_api_key
Content-Type: application/json
```

## API Surfaces

- **Agent API (API key auth):** `/api/agent/*`
  - Authenticate with `X-Agent-Key`
  - Used for autonomous agent execution (wallets list/create/import, transactions, balance, transfer, swap, quote, approve)
- **Dashboard/User API (session auth):** `/api/wallets/*`
  - Authenticate with bearer token or `aw_session` cookie
  - Used for user-managed dashboard operations (including wallet import and wallet creation).
  - Dashboard wallet creation now requires `exportPassphrase` (minimum 12 characters).
  - Private-key export requires `exportPassphrase` and is protected by rate limits and temporary lockouts.

## Workflow

1. `GET /api/agent/wallets` - Discover available wallets (id, label, address, network, chain). Optional `?includeBalances=true` adds native `balance` + `nativeSymbol`
2. `GET /api/agent/wallet?walletId=...` or `?walletLabel=...` or `?walletAddress=...` - Fetch one wallet with native/token balances
3. Optional wallet lifecycle actions:
   - `POST /api/agent/wallets/create` - Create a new wallet under API-key policy controls
   - `POST /api/agent/wallets/import` - Import a `mainnet` or `solana-mainnet` wallet under API-key policy controls
4. `GET /api/agent/transactions?walletId=...` (or `walletLabel`/`walletAddress`) - Read merged wallet transaction history (on-chain + app-recorded)
5. `GET /api/agent/supported-tokens?network=...` or `?chain=evm|solana` - Get recommended common, well-known token list + guidance (requires `X-Agent-Key`)
6. `POST /api/agent/token-balance` - Check wallet balances (native + token balances; specific token by symbol/address supported)
7. `POST /api/agent/quote` - Get a swap quote before execution on Uniswap (EVM) or Jupiter (Solana mainnet)
8. `POST /api/agent/swap` - Execute token swap on Uniswap (EVM) or Jupiter (Solana mainnet)
9. `POST /api/agent/transfer` - Send native coin or token on the wallet's chain (optional `chain` guard)
10. Use returned `txHash` values to confirm transactions

### Approval Handling For Agents

Use this pattern for write actions:

1. At the first write-intent in a session, ask one short onboarding question:
   - "Do you want approval for every write action, or should I operate on your behalf for this session?"
2. Store the chosen mode in conversation memory.
3. If the mode is `confirm_each_write`:
   - ask for approval before each transfer, swap, approval, import, or wallet creation
   - after approval, execute with the MCP write tool or the legacy CLI fallback with `--yes`
4. If the mode is `operate_on_my_behalf`:
   - do not ask again for each transfer
   - when the user later says things like "send X to Y" or "swap A for B", execute with the MCP write tool or the legacy CLI fallback with `--yes` once the needed details are clear
5. In either mode:
   - if execution details are missing, ask only for the missing details
   - if the user changes modes or revokes permission, update memory and follow the new rule

Recommended onboarding wording:

- "Choose write approval mode for this session: `confirm_each_write` or `operate_on_my_behalf`."

Example:

- User selects: `operate_on_my_behalf`
- Later user message: "Send 100 USDC from wallet Q7X2K9P to 0xabc... on Ethereum."
- If MCP is available, the agent should call the matching MCP write tool directly.
- If MCP is not available, the agent should execute:
  ```bash
  bash scripts/agentwalletapi.sh transfer Q7X2K9P 0xabc... 100 USDC evm --yes
  ```
- The agent should not ask for transfer permission again in that same session unless the user revokes the mode or the instruction is ambiguous.

## Agent Wallet Create/Import (Agent API)

Agent-side wallet lifecycle endpoints:

- `POST /api/agent/wallets/create`
- `POST /api/agent/wallets/import`

Behavior notes:
- Both require `X-Agent-Key`.
- Both are gated by API key permissions configured in dashboard:
  - `allowWalletCreation` for create
  - `allowWalletImport` for import
- Both are rate-limited per API key. Exceeding the limit returns `429` with `Retry-After`.
- Agent import supports `mainnet` and `solana-mainnet`.
- Agent wallet create requires:
  - `exportPassphrase` (minimum 12 characters)
  - `exportPassphraseStorageType`
  - `exportPassphraseStorageRef`
  - `confirmExportPassphraseSaved: true`
- Agent-safe create sequence:
  - Save export passphrase in secure storage first.
  - Prefer env-backed storage for local agents.
  - Record the storage location you used.
  - Then call `POST /api/agent/wallets/create` with:
    - the passphrase
    - `exportPassphraseStorageType`
    - `exportPassphraseStorageRef`
    - `confirmExportPassphraseSaved: true`
  - For MCP and the legacy CLI fallback, env-backed storage is the strongest path because the local tool can verify the env var exists before wallet creation.

## Transfer Examples

Send native coin (default when no token specified):
```json
{ "walletId": "Q7X2K9P", "to": "0xRecipient...", "amount": "0.01" }
```

Send 100 USDC by symbol:
```json
{ "walletLabel": "Trading Bot", "to": "0xRecipient...", "token": "USDC", "amount": "100" }
```

Send arbitrary ERC-20 by contract address:
```json
{ "walletId": "Q7X2K9P", "to": "0xRecipient...", "token": "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48", "amount": "100" }
```

Send SOL by symbol:
```json
{ "walletId": "Q7X2K9P", "to": "SolanaRecipientWalletAddress...", "token": "SOL", "amount": "0.01" }
```

Send SOL with memo (Solana only):
```json
{ "walletId": "Q7X2K9P", "to": "SolanaRecipientWalletAddress...", "token": "SOL", "amount": "0.01", "memo": "payment verification note" }
```

Use `amount` for human-readable values (e.g., "100" = 100 USDC). Use `value` for base units (smallest denomination on each chain).
Use optional `chain: "evm" | "solana"` in agent payloads for explicit chain routing and validation.
`memo` is supported only for Solana transfers and must pass safety validation (max 5 words, max 256 UTF-8 bytes, no control/invisible characters).
Native transfers (EVM + Solana) enforce a minimum transferable amount preflight that accounts for platform fee and network fee; Solana may also require a larger first funding transfer for a brand-new recipient address.
For native SOL transfers, the API may auto-adjust requested value to fit platform fee + network fee.
Transfer responses include `requestedValue`, `adjustedValue`, `requestedAmount`, and `adjustedAmount`.

## Token Support Model

- `GET /api/agent/supported-tokens` returns recommended common, well-known tokens plus guidance fields.
- EVM transfer/swap/balance endpoints support **any valid ERC-20 token contract address**.
- Solana transfer/balance endpoints support **any valid SPL mint address**.
- Native tokens appear as `ETH` on EVM and `SOL` on Solana (with chain-specific native token IDs in balance payloads).

## Error Codes

- 200: Success
- 400: Invalid input, insufficient funds, unknown token, or policy violation
- 400 `chain_mismatch`: requested `chain` does not match the selected wallet
- 400 `amount_below_min_transfer`: requested native transfer is below minimum transferable amount after fee/network preflight
- 400 `insufficient_balance`: requested transfer + fees exceed available balance
- 401: Missing/invalid API key
- 404: Wallet not found
- 500: Internal error (retry with corrected payload or reduced amount)

## Policy Constraints

Wallets may have governance policies:
- **Whitelist**: Only transfers to pre-approved addresses allowed
- **Spending Limit**: Max value per transaction (configured per wallet policy)

Violations return HTTP 401 with an explanation message.

## Important Notes

- All POST requests require `Content-Type: application/json`
- EVM token transfers require ETH in the wallet for gas fees
- Solana token transfers require SOL in the wallet for fees
- Solana transfer memos are optional and Solana-only: max 5 words, max 256 UTF-8 bytes, no control/invisible characters
- Solana native transfers account for network fee and can auto-adjust requested transfer amount
- Native transfers may return `400 amount_below_min_transfer` when requested amount is too small after platform fee or below chain transferability minimum (for example, first funding a new Solana address)
- If requested native SOL + platform fee + network fee cannot fit wallet balance, API returns `400 insufficient_balance`
- Swap supports EVM (Uniswap) and Solana mainnet (Jupiter); Quote supports EVM and Solana mainnet; Approve is EVM-only
- A platform fee (default 1%) is deducted from the token amount
- Use `amount` for simplicity, use `value` for precise base-unit control
- For robust agent behavior:
  - First call `wallets`, then `wallet` (or `token-balance`), then `quote`, then `swap`.
  - On 400 with `insufficient_token_balance`, reduce amount or change token.
- The `.env` file in this skill folder stores your API key — never commit it to version control
