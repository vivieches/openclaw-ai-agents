  Production-grade Playwright testing toolkit. Generate tests from specs, fix
  flaky failures, migrate from Cypress/Selenium, sync with TestRail, run on
  BrowserStack. 55 templates, 3 agents, smart reporting. Use when user asks
  about Playwright testing, e2e tests, test automation, cross-browser testing,

# Playwright Pro

Production-grade Playwright testing toolkit for AI coding agents.

## Available Commands

When installed as a Claude Code plugin, these are available as `/pw:` commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/pw:init` | Set up Playwright — detects framework, generates config, CI, first test |
| `/pw:generate <spec>` | Generate tests from user story, URL, or component |
| `/pw:review` | Review tests for anti-patterns and coverage gaps |
| `/pw:fix <test>` | Diagnose and fix failing or flaky tests |
| `/pw:migrate` | Migrate from Cypress or Selenium to Playwright |
| `/pw:coverage` | Analyze what's tested vs. what's missing |
| `/pw:testrail` | Sync with TestRail — read cases, push results |
| `/pw:browserstack` | Run on BrowserStack, pull cross-browser reports |
| `/pw:report` | Generate test report in your preferred format |

## Golden Rules

1. `getByRole()` over CSS/XPath — resilient to markup changes
2. Never `page.waitForTimeout()` — use web-first assertions
3. `expect(locator)` auto-retries; `expect(await locator.textContent())` does not
4. Isolate every test — no shared state between tests
5. `baseURL` in config — zero hardcoded URLs
6. Retries: `2` in CI, `0` locally
7. Traces: `'on-first-retry'` — rich debugging without slowdown
8. Fixtures over globals — `test.extend()` for shared state
9. One behavior per test — multiple related assertions are fine
10. Mock external services only — never mock your own app

## Locator Priority

```
1. getByRole()        — buttons, links, headings, form elements
2. getByLabel()       — form fields with labels
3. getByText()        — non-interactive text
4. getByPlaceholder() — inputs with placeholder
5. getByTestId()      — when no semantic option exists
6. page.locator()     — CSS/XPath as last resort
```
